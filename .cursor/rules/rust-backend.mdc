# Rust Backend Development Guidelines

## Required Documentation References

**MUST READ before any Rust changes:**
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/system-overview.md` - System architecture and crate organization
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/rust-backend.md` - Rust backend development patterns
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/development-conventions.md` - Rust-specific patterns and database conventions

**FOR SPECIFIC CRATES:**
- Reference `ai-docs/03-crates/[specific-crate].md` for detailed crate documentation

## Follow Documentation Patterns

All database layer patterns, service layer patterns, testing standards, and error handling guidelines are comprehensively documented in the referenced ai-docs files above. Refer to those documents for the authoritative guidance rather than duplicating conventions here.
