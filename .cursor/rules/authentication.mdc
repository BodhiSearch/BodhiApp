# Authentication and Authorization Guidelines

## Required Documentation References

**MUST READ before auth changes:**
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/authentication.md` - OAuth2 and JWT patterns, security implementation
- `ai-docs/03-crates/auth_middleware.md` - Middleware implementation details
- `ai-docs/06-knowledge-transfer/llm-resource-server.md` - OAuth2 resource server patterns and vision

## Follow Documentation Patterns

All authentication flow patterns, OAuth2 integration details, application states, frontend authentication patterns, backend implementation guidelines, and security best practices are comprehensively documented in the referenced ai-docs files above. Refer to those documents for the authoritative guidance rather than duplicating conventions here.
