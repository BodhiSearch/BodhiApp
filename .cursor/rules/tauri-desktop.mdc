# Tauri Desktop Application Guidelines

## Required Documentation References

**MUST READ before Tauri changes:**
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/tauri-desktop.md` - Desktop app architecture and native OS integration
- `ai-docs/03-crates/bodhi-tauri.md` - Specific implementation patterns and examples
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/system-overview.md` - Overall system understanding

## Follow Documentation Patterns

All architectural principles, native integration patterns, build process patterns, and implementation standards are comprehensively documented in the referenced ai-docs files above. Refer to those documents for the authoritative guidance rather than duplicating conventions here.
