# Services Crate - Database Layer Guidelines

## Required Documentation

**MUST READ before database changes:**
- `ai-docs/03-crates/services.md` - Services crate architecture and patterns
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/development-conventions.md` - Database conventions section
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/rust-backend.md` - Rust backend development patterns

## Follow Documentation Patterns

All migration standards, model definitions, service implementation patterns, query patterns, and service trait patterns are comprehensively documented in the referenced ai-docs files above. Refer to those documents for the authoritative guidance rather than duplicating conventions here.
