# API Routes and Endpoints Guidelines

## Required Documentation References

**MUST READ before API changes:**
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/system-overview.md` - API architecture understanding and system design
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/api-integration.md` - API integration patterns and error handling
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/development-conventions.md` - Backend conventions and patterns

**FOR SPECIFIC ROUTE TYPES:**
- `ai-docs/03-crates/routes_oai.md` - OpenAI-compatible API patterns
- `ai-docs/03-crates/routes_app.md` - Application-specific API patterns
- `ai-docs/03-crates/routes_all.md` - Unified route composition

## Follow Documentation Patterns

All endpoint naming conventions, implementation patterns, OpenAPI documentation requirements, error handling guidelines, and compatibility standards are comprehensively documented in the referenced ai-docs files above. Refer to those documents for the authoritative guidance rather than duplicating conventions here.
