# Build and Configuration Guidelines

## Required Documentation References

**MUST READ for build/config changes:**
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/build-config.md` - Build systems, configuration management, and deployment patterns
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/tauri-desktop.md` - Tauri build patterns and desktop packaging
- `ai-docs/03-crates/[crate-name].md` - Specific crate documentation for Cargo.toml changes

## Follow Documentation Patterns

All package management guidelines, GitHub workflow patterns, development environment setup, build scripts, and configuration management practices are comprehensively documented in the referenced ai-docs files above. Refer to those documents for the authoritative guidance rather than duplicating conventions here.
