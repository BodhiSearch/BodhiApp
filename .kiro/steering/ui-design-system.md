# UI/UX Design System Guidelines

## Required Documentation

**MUST READ before styling changes:**
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/ui-design-system.md` - Layout patterns, visual hierarchy, and component patterns

## Follow Design System Documentation

All visual hierarchy guidelines, responsive design rules, component patterns, and styling requirements are comprehensively documented in the referenced ai-docs file above. Refer to that document for the authoritative design system guidance rather than duplicating patterns here.
