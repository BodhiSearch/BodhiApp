# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves analyzing and updating existing CLAUDE.md and PACKAGE.md documentation files across all crates in the BodhiApp multi-crate workspace. The goal is to ensure these regularly maintained files accurately reflect the current state, dependencies, and architecture while preserving their existing structure and maintaining Git history through incremental updates rather than complete rewrites.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to analyze existing CLAUDE.md files and update them with current information, so that the documentation accurately reflects the current crate state while preserving the established structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing CLAUDE.md files THEN the system SHALL read and understand the current documentation structure
2. WHEN examining dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify that listed dependencies match current Cargo.toml files
3. WHEN reviewing architecture descriptions THEN the system SHALL validate that crate relationships are accurately described
4. WHEN checking code examples THEN the system SHALL ensure examples reflect current implementation patterns
5. WHEN updating content THEN the system SHALL make incremental changes that preserve Git history and existing structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to analyze existing PACKAGE.md files for complex crates and update technical details, so that detailed implementation information remains current and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining existing PACKAGE.md files THEN the system SHALL understand the current technical documentation approach
2. WHEN reviewing service coordination patterns THEN the system SHALL verify that cross-service integration examples are current
3. WHEN analyzing domain logic descriptions THEN the system SHALL ensure business logic documentation matches implementation
4. WHEN checking testing documentation THEN the system SHALL validate that testing strategies reflect current test code
5. WHEN updating technical details THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing detailed documentation style

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to analyze test_utils documentation patterns and apply them consistently, so that test fixture creation and testing approaches are well-documented across crates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining test_utils documentation THEN the system SHALL understand how test fixtures and utilities are documented
2. WHEN analyzing test code THEN the system SHALL identify usage patterns of test utilities and fixtures
3. WHEN reviewing testing approaches THEN the system SHALL document how test_utils facilitate thorough testing
4. WHEN updating test documentation THEN the system SHALL include concrete examples from actual test implementations
5. WHEN documenting test patterns THEN the system SHALL show how test_utils reduce testing effort and complexity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to create CLAUDE.md files for crates that lack them, so that all crates have consistent documentation coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying missing CLAUDE.md files THEN the system SHALL create new documentation following established patterns
2. WHEN analyzing undocumented crates THEN the system SHALL thoroughly examine the crate's purpose and implementation
3. WHEN creating new documentation THEN the system SHALL follow the structure and style of existing CLAUDE.md files
4. WHEN documenting new crates THEN the system SHALL ensure integration points with other crates are clearly described
5. WHEN writing new content THEN the system SHALL provide practical usage examples and development guidelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to ensure all documentation accurately reflects current workspace structure and dependencies, so that I can work with up-to-date information about crate relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating workspace structure THEN the system SHALL verify that documented crate relationships match current Cargo.toml workspace members
2. WHEN checking dependency information THEN the system SHALL ensure all major dependencies are accurately described with current versions
3. WHEN reviewing integration points THEN the system SHALL validate that cross-crate usage patterns are correctly documented
4. WHEN updating architecture descriptions THEN the system SHALL ensure the crate's position in the overall system is accurately described
5. WHEN maintaining documentation THEN the system SHALL preserve existing quality while correcting any outdated information
