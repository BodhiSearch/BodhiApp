# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need for proper Docker installation setup validation and user guidance for the BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable. Currently, Docker installations may fail or behave unexpectedly if this critical environment variable is not properly configured. The feature will provide clear feedback to users about missing configuration and guide them through the setup process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Docker user running BodhiApp, I want to be clearly informed when the BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable is not set, so that I can properly configure my installation before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in Docker mode AND the BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable is not set THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the missing configuration
2. WHEN the missing encryption key error is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide specific instructions on how to set the environment variable
3. WHEN the missing encryption key error is displayed THEN the system SHALL include examples of how to set the variable for different Docker run scenarios (docker run, docker-compose, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Docker user, I want the application to validate the BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY during startup, so that I can be confident my installation is properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in Docker mode THEN the system SHALL validate that BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY is present and not empty
2. WHEN the BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent the application from starting normally
3. WHEN the BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the validation error with appropriate severity level
4. WHEN the BODHI_ENCRYPTION_KEY is properly set THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal startup without additional warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Docker user, I want clear guidance on restarting the application after setting the encryption key, so that I can complete the setup process efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the encryption key setup error is displayed THEN the system SHALL include instructions to restart the container after setting the environment variable
2. WHEN providing restart instructions THEN the system SHALL specify that the container needs to be stopped and restarted (not just reloaded)
3. WHEN providing restart instructions THEN the system SHALL include the specific Docker commands needed to restart the container

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the encryption key validation to work consistently across all Docker deployment methods, so that users have a consistent experience regardless of how they deploy BodhiApp.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs via docker run command THEN the encryption key validation SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN the application runs via docker-compose THEN the encryption key validation SHALL work consistently  
3. WHEN the application runs via Kubernetes or other orchestration tools THEN the encryption key validation SHALL work consistently
4. WHEN the application runs in any Docker-based deployment THEN the validation error messages SHALL be identical across all deployment methods
