# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to configure remote AI API services (such as OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, etc.) as model aliases within the Bodhi system. Instead of only supporting local llama-server models, users will be able to create aliases that route requests to external AI providers, allowing seamless integration of multiple AI services through a unified interface. The system will handle API key management, request translation, and response normalization to provide a consistent experience regardless of the underlying AI provider.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remote API Provider Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure remote AI API providers as model aliases, so that I can use external AI services alongside local models through the same interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a model alias THEN the system SHALL support a new alias type for remote API providers
2. WHEN configuring a remote API alias THEN the system SHALL require provider type (openai, anthropic, google, etc.)
3. WHEN configuring a remote API alias THEN the system SHALL require API endpoint URL and authentication credentials
4. WHEN configuring a remote API alias THEN the system SHALL allow specifying the remote model name/ID
5. WHEN storing remote API aliases THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive credentials before persistence

### Requirement 2: API Key and Authentication Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely store and manage API keys for different AI providers, so that I can authenticate with external services without exposing credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using secure encryption methods
2. WHEN retrieving API credentials THEN the system SHALL decrypt them only when needed for API calls
3. WHEN configuring authentication THEN the system SHALL support different auth methods (API key, bearer token, custom headers)
4. WHEN managing credentials THEN the system SHALL allow updating credentials without recreating aliases
5. WHEN displaying credentials in UI THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive information

### Requirement 3: Request Translation and Routing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want requests to remote API aliases to be automatically translated to the appropriate provider format, so that I can use a consistent interface regardless of the underlying AI service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a request for a remote API alias THEN the system SHALL identify the target provider
2. WHEN translating requests THEN the system SHALL convert OpenAI-compatible format to provider-specific format
3. WHEN routing requests THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate HTTP client configuration for each provider
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL include proper credentials in the outbound request
5. WHEN request translation fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Response Normalization

**User Story:** As a client application, I want responses from remote AI APIs to be normalized to a consistent format, so that I can process responses uniformly regardless of the provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving responses from remote APIs THEN the system SHALL normalize them to OpenAI-compatible format
2. WHEN normalizing responses THEN the system SHALL preserve essential metadata (model, usage, etc.)
3. WHEN handling streaming responses THEN the system SHALL maintain streaming compatibility
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL normalize error responses to consistent format
5. WHEN response normalization fails THEN the system SHALL return the original response with appropriate warnings

### Requirement 5: Provider-Specific Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure provider-specific settings for remote AI APIs, so that I can optimize the behavior for each service's capabilities and limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OpenAI-compatible providers THEN the system SHALL support standard OpenAI parameters
2. WHEN configuring Anthropic Claude THEN the system SHALL support Claude-specific parameters (system messages, etc.)
3. WHEN configuring Google Gemini THEN the system SHALL support Gemini-specific parameters and safety settings
4. WHEN configuring custom providers THEN the system SHALL allow flexible parameter mapping
5. WHEN provider configurations conflict THEN the system SHALL use provider-specific defaults

### Requirement 6: Frontend UI for Remote API Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface to create and manage remote AI API aliases, so that I can easily configure external AI services without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating aliases THEN the UI SHALL provide a dropdown to select between local and remote API types
2. WHEN selecting remote API type THEN the UI SHALL show provider-specific configuration forms
3. WHEN entering API credentials THEN the UI SHALL provide secure input fields with masking
4. WHEN testing configurations THEN the UI SHALL provide a "test connection" feature
5. WHEN managing existing remote aliases THEN the UI SHALL allow editing without exposing credentials

### Requirement 7: Health Monitoring and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health of remote API connections and handle failures gracefully, so that I can ensure reliable service for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remote API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN providers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully
4. WHEN monitoring health THEN the system SHALL provide status endpoints for remote API aliases
5. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL provide clear troubleshooting information

### Requirement 8: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want remote API integrations to follow security best practices, so that my data and credentials remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL use industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
3. WHEN logging requests THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive information
4. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL respect provider privacy policies
5. WHEN credentials are compromised THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to rotate them quickly
