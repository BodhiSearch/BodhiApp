## Important Constraints

### Test Environment Requirements

- **OAuth2 Server Access**: Tests require access to a live OAuth2 server with configured test clients and users
- **Model File Dependencies**: Tests depend on specific small model files (Llama-68M variants) for fast execution
- **Serial Execution**: Live server tests must run serially due to resource conflicts and port binding
- **Environment Configuration**: Tests require specific environment variables for OAuth2 configuration and test credentials

### Resource Management Constraints

- **Temporary Directory Cleanup**: All tests must properly clean up temporary directories and test data
- **Server Process Lifecycle**: Live server tests must ensure proper server shutdown to prevent resource leaks
- **Authentication Session Management**: Tests must properly manage OAuth2 tokens and session cleanup
- **Port Allocation**: Live server tests use random port allocation to prevent conflicts

### Test Data Management Constraints

- **Configuration Consistency**: Test configuration files must match production structure for accurate testing

## Cross-Crate Integration Patterns

### Live Server Testing with OAuth2 Authentication

The integration tests demonstrate complete authentication flows using real OAuth2 tokens and session management:

- **OAuth2 Token Acquisition**: Tests acquire real access and refresh tokens using client credentials flow
- **Session Creation**: Tests create database-backed sessions with proper token storage using tower-sessions
- **Cookie-Based Authentication**: Tests use secure HTTP cookies for session-based authentication rather than Bearer tokens
- **Multi-Service Coordination**: Tests validate coordination between auth_middleware, services, and server_core components

### Test Data Management and Environment Isolation

The crate implements sophisticated test data management that simulates production environments:

- **HuggingFace Cache Simulation**: Complete hub cache structure with model blobs, snapshots, and metadata files

- **Model File Management**: Small test models (Llama-68M variants) enable fast test execution while maintaining realism
- **Configuration Copying**: Test configuration files are copied from version-controlled test data to temporary environments

### Service Integration and Dependency Injection

Integration tests validate complex service coordination patterns across the application:

- **Mock Service Integration**: Tests use OfflineHubService and MockSettingService for controlled testing environments
- **Service Builder Patterns**: Tests demonstrate proper service construction using AppServiceBuilder with custom implementations
- **Shared Context Management**: Tests validate DefaultSharedContext lifecycle with server factory coordination
- **Cross-Service Communication**: Tests ensure proper data flow between services, middleware, and route handlers

### Live Server Testing Infrastructure Implementation

### Test Execution Patterns and Resource Management

**Serial Test Execution** (using `#[serial_test::serial(live)]`):

- All live server tests run serially to prevent resource conflicts
- Tests use the `serial(live)` attribute to ensure proper resource isolation
- Each test gets exclusive access to server ports and authentication resources

**Timeout Management** (using `#[timeout(Duration::from_secs(5 * 60))]`):

- Tests have 5-minute timeouts to prevent hanging in CI environments
- Timeout handling ensures proper resource cleanup even on test failures

**Fixture-Based Test Setup** (using `rstest` fixtures):

- `llama2_7b_setup` fixture provides complete application service setup with OAuth2 configuration
- `live_server` fixture builds on the setup to provide running server instances
- Fixtures handle complex dependency injection and service coordination

**Error Handling and Cleanup**:

- Tests use `anyhow::Result` for comprehensive error handling
- Proper cleanup of temporary directories, server processes, and authentication sessions
- Resource cleanup occurs even when tests fail or timeout

## Test Infrastructure Implementation

### TestServerHandle Structure

The actual test infrastructure uses `TestServerHandle` (see `tests/utils/live_server_utils.rs:139-145`):

```rust
pub struct TestServerHandle {
  pub temp_cache_dir: TempDir,
  pub host: String,
  pub port: u16,
  pub handle: ServerShutdownHandle,
  pub app_service: Arc<dyn AppService>,
}
```

**Key Infrastructure Components**:

- **Temporary Directory Management**: Each test gets isolated temporary cache directories with proper cleanup
- **Random Port Allocation**: Tests use random ports (2000-60000 range) to prevent conflicts
- **Server Lifecycle Management**: Uses `ServerShutdownHandle` from server_app for proper shutdown coordination
- **Service Access**: Provides access to the complete `AppService` for authentication and testing utilities

### Authentication Testing Infrastructure

**OAuth2 Token Management** (see `get_oauth_tokens` function):

- Real OAuth2 token acquisition using client credentials and password flows
- Environment-based configuration for test OAuth2 servers and credentials
- Support for access token and refresh token management

**Session Management** (see `create_authenticated_session` function):

- Database-backed session creation using tower-sessions
- Proper token storage in session data with expiration management
- Session cookie creation for HTTP-based authentication testing
