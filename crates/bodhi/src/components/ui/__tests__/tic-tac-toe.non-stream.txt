  Sure! Here is a simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python:

```
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# Function to play game
def play_game(game):
    # Checking for win
    if check_win(game):
        print(\"Game Over! You won!\")
    else:
        print(\"It's your turn!\")
        # Asking user to make a move
        move = input(\"Enter a row and column to make a move (e.g. '1,1' or '1,3'): \")
        row, col = map(int, move.split(\",\"))
        # Updating game state
        game[row][col] = \"X\" if game[row][col] == \"O\" else \"O\"
        # Recursively calling itself
        play_game(game)

# Function to check for win
def check_win(game):
    # Checking for vertical win
    if game[0][0] == game[0][1] and game[0][1] == game[0][2]:
        return True
    # Checking for horizontal win
    elif game[0][0] == game[1][0] and game[1][0] == game[2][0]:
        return True
    # Checking for diagonal win
    elif game[0][0] == game[1][1] and game[1][1] == game[2][1]:
        return True
    # Checking for corner win
    elif game[0][0] == game[0][1] and game[0][1] == game[0][2] or
            game[1][0] == game[1][1] and game[1][1] == game[1][2] or
            game[2][0] == game[2][1] and game[2][1] == game[2][2]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Initializing game state
game = np.zeros((3, 3))

# Playing game
play_game(game)
```
This implementation uses the NumPy library to create a 2D array to store the game state. The `play_game` function takes the current game state as input, checks for a win, and then recursively calls itself until the game is over. The `check_win` function checks for a win by comparing the current state to a list of possible win conditions.

You can run this code by saving it to a file with a `.py` extension and running it in a Python interpreter. For example, you can run it by opening a terminal and typing `python tic_tac_toe.py`.

Note that this is a very basic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, and you may want to add additional features such as displaying the current game state, allowing the user to reset the game, or keeping track of the number of moves made by each player.
