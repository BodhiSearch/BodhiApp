# Install Bodhi App

Bodhi App is currently available only for macOS on M‑series devices. It is designed as a multi‑platform application, and support for additional platforms will be rolled out soon.

## System Requirements

- **Memory:** 16GB RAM
- **Storage:** <50MB for app installation, ~5GB for model download
- **Processor:** ARM-64 processor
- **Operating System:** macOS 14.0 or later

## Installation Steps

### macOS Installation
1. Download the macOS `.dmg` file from our releases page.
2. Open the disk image and drag Bodhi App into your Applications folder.
3. Launch Bodhi App from the Applications folder.

## Post-Installation: Setup & Launch Flow

Once installed on macOS, follow these steps:

### 1. Launching Bodhi App
When you launch Bodhi App, the app icon appears in your system tray and a browser window automatically opens on [localhost:1135](http://localhost:1135).

### 2. Initiating the Setup Flow
On first launch, Bodhi App starts the setup flow and prompts you to choose your installation mode.

### 3. Configuring Authentication
During setup, choose between:
- **Authenticated Mode:** You will be required to log in using a valid email address which will become the admin account. (This mode enforces production‑grade security and role‑based access control.)
- **Non‑Authenticated Mode:** The app is configured for open access. (Note: You cannot switch modes later due to security risks.)

### 4. Downloading Models
After configuring authentication, the app navigates to the Downloads Models page. Here, a selection of popular models—compatible with your system—is displayed. Choose the models you wish to download; these downloads will continue in the background.
