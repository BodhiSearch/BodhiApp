# Welcome to Bodhi App

Bodhi App is a cross‑platform LLM inference tool that seamlessly integrates with the HuggingFace ecosystem and is powered by the llama.cpp server. Whether you're a non‑technical user exploring AI or a developer building sophisticated AI‑powered applications, Bodhi App delivers a rich set of features designed to empower your journey.

## Key Features
- **OpenAI Compatible Chat and Model APIs**  
  Our chat completions and models API is OpenAI compatible, so you can seamlessly integrate with any tool that accepts OpenAI's API endpoints.

- **Ollama Compatible Chat and Model APIs**  
  We also offer Ollama compatible API - chat and models endpoints, providing flexibility and integration options for users within the Ollama ecosystem.

- **Advanced Security & Authentication**  
  Bodhi App provides a flexible, opt‑in security policy. Choose the mode that best suits your needs:  
  - **Authenticated Mode:** Benefit from production‑grade authentication and role‑based access control (supporting roles such as user, power user, manager, and admin).  
  - **Non‑Authenticated Mode:** Get started quickly without login hassles—ideal for local testing and exploration.
  This robust security framework ensures your LLM servers are safeguarded whether hosted locally or in the cloud.

- **Built-in Chat UI**  
  Say goodbye to separate installations—Bodhi App includes a ready‑to‑use Chat UI featuring markdown support (with code blocks and copy functionality), multi‑conversation management, customizable system prompts, and real‑time feedback. For those who prefer an external Chat frontend, our OpenAI‑compatible API endpoints make integration effortless.

- **Model Alias**  
  Easily create and save your inference configurations by specifying your preferred request parameters and llama‑server settings—such as temperature and context size. Switch between configurations seamlessly without any restarts.

- **Model Files Management**  
  Manage your AI model files seamlessly with the HuggingFace ecosystem. Models are downloaded into your local HuggingFace home folder, and any compatible GGUF models already present can be used for inference. This design saves disk space and bandwidth by reusing your existing resources.

- **Robust API Access & Developer Tools**  
  Benefit from comprehensive API documentation and developer tools. Whether you are generating API tokens or integrating Bodhi App into external applications, every technical detail is supported.

- **Future‑Ready and Cross‑Platform**
