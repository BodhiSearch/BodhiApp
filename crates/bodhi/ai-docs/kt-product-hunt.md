#### Meta/Llama Shout-out
```markdown
A massive shout out to @Meta and the Llama team! ü¶ô

Their commitment to open science through the Llama models has been transformative for AI accessibility. The release of Llama 2 and now Llama 3 under permissive licenses has democratized access to state-of-the-art language models.

What makes Llama special:
‚Ä¢ High-quality open-source models that rival proprietary ones
‚Ä¢ Clear licensing for both research and commercial use
‚Ä¢ Continuous innovation with each release
‚Ä¢ Extensive documentation and research transparency
‚Ä¢ Strong community support and ecosystem

The Llama models have become the foundation for many open-source AI projects, including Bodhi App. Their work proves that cutting-edge AI can be both open and excellent.

Thank you Meta for championing open-source AI! üöÄ
```

#### HuggingFace Shout-out
```markdown

HuggingFace has revolutionized AI accessibility through their incredible open-source ecosystem. They've created not just a model hub, but a complete infrastructure that makes AI truly accessible to everyone.

What makes HuggingFace amazing:
‚Ä¢ The Hub: A central repository for models, datasets, and spaces
‚Ä¢ Transformers library: Making ML accessible to developers
‚Ä¢ Model Cards: Setting standards for model documentation
‚Ä¢ GGUF format: Enabling efficient model distribution
‚Ä¢ Community: Building the largest open-source AI community

Bodhi App is built on top of the HuggingFace ecosystem:
‚Ä¢ Direct integration with the Hub for model downloads

‚Ä¢ Leveraging their chat templates
‚Ä¢ Following their best practices

Thank you HuggingFace for:
‚Ä¢ Democratizing AI through open source
‚Ä¢ Building incredible developer tools
‚Ä¢ Fostering transparency in AI
‚Ä¢ Creating a welcoming community
‚Ä¢ Making AI accessible to everyone

Your commitment to open source and AI democratization perfectly aligns with our mission at Bodhi App. üöÄ
```

#### Cursor IDE Shout-out
```markdown
Huge shout out to @Cursor! üéØ

Thank you for solving one of humanity's greatest challenges - aligning those divs! üòÖ But seriously, you've revolutionized how we code with AI.

What makes Cursor amazing:
‚Ä¢ Seamless AI integration right in the IDE
‚Ä¢ Making developers 10x more productive
‚Ä¢ Natural language code editing (goodbye cryptic commands!)
‚Ä¢ Smart codebase understanding
‚Ä¢ That magical "Tab, tab, tab" prediction

As someone building developer tools, I'm inspired by how you've:
‚Ä¢ Made AI assistance feel natural in coding workflow
‚Ä¢ Kept the familiar VSCode experience while adding AI superpowers
‚Ä¢ Created an IDE that actually understands your codebase
‚Ä¢ Solved real developer pain points (yes, including div alignment! üéØ)

Your work shows how AI can enhance rather than replace developer creativity. Thanks for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in development tools! 

P.S. That div alignment feature alone deserves a medal üèÜ
