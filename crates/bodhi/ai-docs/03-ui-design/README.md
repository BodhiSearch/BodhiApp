# UI/UX Design Documentation

This section contains user interface and user experience design documentation for the Bodhi App, including design systems, component specifications, and usability guidelines.

## Contents

### Design Foundation
- **[Design System](design-system.md)** - Color system, typography, theming, and visual hierarchy
- **[Component Library](component-library.md)** - Reusable UI components and patterns
- **[UX Analysis](ux-analysis.md)** - User experience analysis and improvement recommendations

### Feature-Specific Design
- **[Model Pages](model-pages.md)** - Model management and configuration UI designs

## Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Consistency** - Unified visual language across all interfaces
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive design
- **Responsiveness** - Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Clarity** - Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive information architecture
- **Performance** - Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions

### User Experience
- **Simplicity** - Minimize cognitive load with clean, focused interfaces
- **Efficiency** - Streamlined workflows for common tasks
- **Feedback** - Clear system status and user action feedback
- **Error Prevention** - Design patterns that prevent user errors
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Interaction Design
- **Touch-Friendly** - Appropriate touch targets for mobile devices
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal complexity gradually as needed
- **Contextual Actions** - Actions available when and where needed
- **Consistent Patterns** - Familiar interaction patterns throughout

## Design System Overview

### Color System
- **Semantic Colors** - Purpose-driven color tokens
- **Theme Support** - Light and dark mode compatibility
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliant contrast ratios
- **Brand Alignment** - Colors that reflect Bodhi's identity

### Typography
- **Hierarchy** - Clear typographic scale for content organization
- **Readability** - Optimized for various screen sizes and conditions
- **Performance** - Efficient font loading and rendering

### Spacing & Layout
- **Grid System** - Consistent spacing and alignment
- **Responsive Breakpoints** - Mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts
- **Component Spacing** - Standardized margins and padding

### Components
- **Atomic Design** - Scalable component architecture
- **Variant System** - Flexible component variations
- **State Management** - Clear visual states for all components

## Mobile-First Approach

### Responsive Strategy
1. **Mobile (320px+)** - Core functionality and content
2. **Tablet (768px+)** - Enhanced layouts and additional features
3. **Desktop (1024px+)** - Full feature set with optimized workflows

### Touch Interactions
- **Minimum Touch Targets** - 44px minimum for accessibility
- **Gesture Support** - Swipe, pinch, and tap interactions
- **Feedback** - Visual and haptic feedback for actions

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
- **Color Contrast** - Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Full functionality without mouse
- **Screen Readers** - Proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
- **Focus Management** - Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

### Inclusive Design
- **Motor Impairments** - Large touch targets and alternative inputs
- **Visual Impairments** - High contrast modes and scalable text
- **Cognitive Accessibility** - Clear language and simple workflows

## Component Standards

### Design Tokens
- **Colors** - Semantic color system with theme variants
- **Typography** - Font sizes, weights, and line heights
- **Spacing** - Consistent spacing scale
- **Shadows** - Elevation system for depth

### Component Specifications
- **Anatomy** - Component structure and parts
- **Variants** - Different visual and functional variations
- **States** - Default, hover, active, disabled, and error states
- **Responsive Behavior** - How components adapt to different screens

### Documentation Requirements
- **Usage Guidelines** - When and how to use components
- **Code Examples** - Implementation examples
- **Accessibility Notes** - Specific accessibility considerations
- **Design Rationale** - Why design decisions were made

## Testing & Validation

### Design Testing
- **Usability Testing** - User testing for design validation
- **Accessibility Testing** - Automated and manual accessibility checks
- **Visual Regression** - Automated visual testing
- **Performance Testing** - Design impact on performance

### Design Reviews
- **Consistency Checks** - Alignment with design system
- **Accessibility Reviews** - Compliance verification
- **Cross-Platform Testing** - Testing across devices and browsers

## Tools & Workflow

### Design Tools
- **Figma** - Primary design tool for UI/UX design
- **Design Tokens** - Automated token generation and sync
- **Prototyping** - Interactive prototypes for testing

### Development Integration
- **Component Library** - Shared component specifications
- **Design Tokens** - Automated token integration
- **Style Guides** - Living documentation

## Contributing

When adding UI/UX documentation:

1. **Follow design system** - Use established patterns and tokens
2. **Include accessibility** - Document accessibility considerations
3. **Provide examples** - Include visual examples and code snippets
4. **Consider responsive** - Document behavior across screen sizes
5. **Test thoroughly** - Validate designs with users and automated tools

## Maintenance

UI/UX documentation should be updated when:
- Design system changes
- New components are added
- Accessibility requirements evolve
- User feedback indicates issues
- Platform capabilities change
