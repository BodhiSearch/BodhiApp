In the past year, I've been developing Bodhi App, an open-source platform that enables running Large Language Models (LLMs) locally on personal computers. The project presented several significant technical challenges that pushed the boundaries of local AI computing, cross-platform compatibility, and user experience.

Core Technical Challenge:
The primary challenge was creating a system that could efficiently run resource-intensive LLMs on consumer-grade hardware while maintaining a pleasant user experience. This required solving complex problems across multiple domains:

1. Concurrent Processing and Resource Management:
- Developed dynamic model loading and unloading mechanisms to efficiently utilize system resources
- Implemented multi-threading for handling concurrent model operations
- Built robust concurrent system for handling multiple user requests

2. Cross-Platform Architecture:
- Designed a platform-agnostic architecture that works seamlessly on macOS (with Docker, Windows and Linux in development, and theoretically can work on iOS and Android)
- Built a modular system that adapts to different hardware configurations
- Developed a compatibility layer to handle platform-specific optimizations
- Created an automated testing framework to verify compatibility across different hardware configurations

3. API Compatibility Layer:
- Built a compatibility layer supporting both OpenAI and Ollama APIs
- Implemented request/response streaming that matches cloud API behavior
- Created a robust error handling system

Current Challenges:
We're actively working on:
1. Expanding platform support to Windows and Linux
2. Optimizing performance for different hardware configurations
3. Improving the model deployment system
4. Enhancing cross-platform compatibility

Impact and Learning:
This project has pushed my understanding of:
- Building concurrent and multi-threaded systems in Rust
- Developing cross-platform applications
- Creating user-friendly interfaces for complex technical systems

The most rewarding aspect has been making AI accessible to developers and users who need to run models locally for privacy, cost, or latency reasons. The project continues to evolve as we tackle new challenges in local AI computing and push the boundaries of what's possible on consumer hardware.
