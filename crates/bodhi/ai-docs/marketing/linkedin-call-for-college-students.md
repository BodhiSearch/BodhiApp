I am looking to reach out to college students, especially those from IITs, NITs, law schools, CA programs, medical schools, and other professional courses! If you're interested in harnessing the power of Large Language Models and Generative AI, I am building something that is going to be very useful for you.

I'm developing Bodhi App (https://www.getbodhi.app), a tool that lets you run LLMs locally on your device - designed specifically for people who do not have a deep technical IT background but are savvy using laptops and mobile devices for their day to day professional needs.

## What makes Bodhi App different:

â€¢ **Zero technical knowledge required** - User-friendly interface designed for non-technical students
â€¢ **Run AI locally** - Keep your data private and work offline
â€¢ **Guided learning** - Does not assume technical know-how, hints and help available throughout the setup process and app including in-app user guide.
â€¢ **Community-driven** - Join fellow students in upskilling together through this AI revolution
â€¢ **Completely FREE** - Runs on your hardware, most optimally, access to powerful open source AI models, no subscription or one-time cost.

This isn't just about enhancing your studies (though it will!) - it's about equipping you with skills that will be invaluable in any profession going forward.

If you're a student looking to stay ahead of the curve, I'd love to connect and provide early access to Bodhi App.

Let's navigate this AI revolution together. ðŸš€
