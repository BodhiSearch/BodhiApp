# Bodhi App as LLM Resource Server

## Core Vision
Bodhi App aims to be the central LLM Resource Server for local AI capabilities, acting as a secure broker between client applications and local AI resources. This vision aligns with YC's interest in a new kind of AI App Store and operating system layer.

## Key Concepts

### Resource Server Architecture
1. Core Functions
   - Local LLM inference capabilities
   - OAuth2-based authentication/authorization
   - Role-based access control
   - API token management
   - Resource usage monitoring

2. Client Integration
   - OAuth2 flows for client app authentication
   - Token exchange mechanisms
   - API compatibility (OpenAI, Ollama)
   - Secure resource access

### Security Model

1. Authentication Modes
   - Authenticated mode with full security features
   - Non-authenticated mode for local testing
   - OAuth2-based user authentication
   - API token-based access

2. Authorization Levels
   - Role-based access (Admin, Manager, Power User, User)
   - Token-based scopes
   - Resource-specific permissions
   - Client application privileges

### Resource Management

1. LLM Resources
   - Model file management
   - Inference configuration
   - Model aliases
   - Performance optimization

2. Future Resources
   - Text-to-Image generation
   - Text-to-Audio conversion
   - Speech-to-Text processing
   - Other AI/ML capabilities

## Client App Ecosystem

### Integration Methods
1. Direct Local Access
   - Local client applications
   - Same-machine access
   - Full API capabilities

2. Remote Access
   - Browser extensions
   - Proxy mechanisms
   - Secure tunneling
   - Network-based access

### Client Authentication Flow
```
Client App ─── OAuth2 Request ───> Bodhi App
    │                                  │
    │<─── User Approval Flow ─────────┘
    │
    │─── Token Exchange ───> Resource Access
```

### Resource Access Pattern
```
Client App ─── API Request + Token ───> Bodhi App
    │                                      │
    │<─── Validated Resource Access ───────┘
```
