# LLM Resource Server: Bodhi App - Knowledge Transfer

This document provides a high-level overview and key design decisions for evolving Bodhi App into a local LLM Resource Server. Bodhi App serves as the core local service for LLM inference, securely exposing its capabilities to client applications via standard OAuth2 protocols and RESTful APIs.

---

## 1. Introduction

Bodhi App is designed to be a robust, secure resource server that orchestrates local LLM inference. It provides a centralized AI resource that client applications can access through authenticated API calls. In its current form, Bodhi App:
- Powers local LLM services (e.g., chat generation, inference) using an underlying LLM processing engine.
- Acts as a gateway for client applications to securely request and process LLM outputs.
- Is envisioned to evolve into a broader GenAI Resource Server—expanding its capabilities into modalities such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and speech-to-text.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

Bodhi App's overall architecture is modular and designed for scalability, security, and efficient resource management. Key components include:

- **LLM Inference Engine:**  
  Utilizes locally-deployed engines (such as implementations based on llama.cpp) that can run various LLM models.  
  - *Model Management & Aliases:* Supports both user-defined and embedded model configurations via YAML files. Model files are downloaded from HuggingFace repositories and stored locally with metadata.

- **Authentication & Authorization Layer:**  
  Ensures that all access to LLM resources is secure.  
  - Supports both session-based (web login with cookies) and token-based (OAuth2, JWT) authentication.
  - Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) with hierarchical roles (for example, resource_admin, resource_manager, resource_user) that determine permissions to access LLM endpoints.

- **API Gateway:**  
  Exposes a set of stateless RESTful endpoints which:
  - Allow client applications to interact with the LLM engine.
  - Handle token exchange and enforce security checks.
  - Provide endpoints for creating, listing, and revoking API tokens.

- **Setup & UI Flow:**  
  A guided setup wizard that:
  - Helps users select between authenticated and non-authenticated modes.
  - Manages the initial admin assignment and configuration.
  - Offers an intuitive interface for model downloads, token management, and application settings.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

### Overview

To secure access to local LLM resources, Bodhi App leverages well-known authentication standards:

- **Session-based Authentication:**  
  Establishes secure user sessions via traditional login mechanisms.

- **Token-based Authentication:**  
  Uses OAuth2 flows to generate JWT-based API tokens. These tokens are stateless and allow client applications to interact with the LLM inference endpoints without being tied to an active session.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Stateless Tokens:**  
  API tokens are designed to operate independently of user sessions. They remain valid provided that they are used within stipulated idle timeouts. This approach facilitates horizontal scalability and simplifies server state management.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  A hierarchical role system ensures that different user roles (e.g., admin, manager, basic user) have defined access levels. This control is critical when client applications, via their tokens, need to perform actions such as managing LLM inferences or generating new tokens.

- **OAuth2 Flows and Token Validation:**  
  Client apps initiate OAuth2 flows for token exchange. Tokens carry claims that are verified (using JWT mechanisms) to ensure authenticity and proper scope validation before permitting LLM requests.

- **Token Caching & Invalidation:**  
  For performance, tokens are cached (with keys based on token identifiers and hash prefixes) and are automatically invalidated when their status changes, ensuring that only active tokens allow resource access.

---

## 4. API & Token Management

### API Endpoints

Bodhi App provides RESTful API endpoints that facilitate interactions with the LLM Resource Server. These include:

- **Token Operations:**  
  - **Create:** POST `/api/tokens` to generate new API tokens.
  - **List:** GET `/api/tokens` to retrieve active tokens.
  - **Revoke/Update:** Endpoints to modify token status or remove tokens.
  
- **Inference Endpoints:**  
  Endpoints that process client requests for LLM inference. These endpoints enforce strict authorization checks based on token claims and user roles before executing inference processes.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Stateless API Design:**  
  The design's stateless nature simplifies horizontal scaling and reduces complexity by isolating each API request from session dependencies.

- **Security Overhead:**  
  Integrated token caching and advanced error logging provide enhanced security and performance when handling multiple simultaneous requests.

- **Clear Client Feedback:**  
  API responses include proper error messaging, ensuring that any issues with token validation or authorization are immediately communicated to the client.

## 5. Setup & UI Flows

Bodhi App includes a user-friendly setup wizard designed to simplify the configuration process:

- **Authentication Mode Selection:**  
  Users choose between **Authenticated Mode** (which enforces strict security and role-based access) and **Non-Authenticated Mode** (for rapid, local-only access). This decision is permanent, highlighting the importance of selecting the right mode for intended use.

- **Admin Role Assignment:**  
  In authenticated mode, the first successful login assigns administrative privileges, enabling full access to app configuration and token services.

- **Configuration and Model Downloads:**  
  Following the authentication step, users are guided through configuring system settings (e.g., application behavior, token management) and downloading necessary LLM models.

- **Responsive UI:**  
  The UI is built to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across both desktop and mobile devices, with clear visual cues, loading states, and error messaging.

## 6. Model Management and Aliases

Central to the LLM Resource Server is the management of local LLM models:

- **Model Downloads:**  
  Bodhi App can download model files from trusted repositories (such as HuggingFace) and stores them locally. The download process is asynchronous and idempotent.

- **Model Alias System:**  
  Using YAML configuration files, users can define model aliases that encapsulate both inference (request) parameters and server-specific (context) parameters. This abstraction allows:
  - Quick switching between different configuration profiles.
  - Consistent application of model parameters across multiple inference sessions.
  
- **Local Storage & Caching:**  
  Efficient local storage ensures that once a model is downloaded, it can be reused for inference without the need for repeated downloads, optimizing both speed and resource usage.

---

## 7. Integration with Client Applications

Bodhi App is engineered to serve as the secure LLM resource for external client applications:

- **OAuth2-Enabled Client Access:**  
  Registered client apps request access via standardized OAuth2 flows. After user consent, they receive access tokens that permit them to query the LLM inference endpoints.

- **Secure Resource Access:**  
  The API gateway enforces strict role- and scope-based checks using token claims, ensuring that only fully authenticated and authorized requests can trigger local LLM processes.

- **Decoupled Architecture:**  
  By separating the authentication layer from the core LLM inference engine, Bodhi App achieves a decoupled design that is both secure and scalable. This allows client apps to operate independently while still benefitting from centralized token management and authorization controls.

## 8. Vision: Secure Exposure of Local LLM Resources via OAuth2

While Bodhi App currently demonstrates powerful local LLM inference capabilities, its long-term vision extends far beyond merely running models on your machine. We aim to evolve Bodhi App into a comprehensive LLM/GenAI resource provider for your machine—where you remain in full control of which applications can access your local AI capabilities.

In this vision:
- The Bodhi App instance is registered as an OAuth2 resource with an authentication server.
- Third-party apps are registered as OAuth2 client apps with the same authentication server.
- Client apps use valid user tokens to request access to your local LLM resources.
- A secure token exchange mechanism converts the client app token to a local LLM resource token for that user, ensuring that security and privileges are transferred in an industry-standard way.

This approach guarantees that:
- You, the user, dictate which applications can connect to your local LLM resources.
- All interactions conform to secure OAuth2 flows, with the ability to monitor and revoke access at any time.
- Even web-based services (for example, to enable Retrieval Augmented Generation over a webpage) can leverage your local inference capabilities—offering significant cost savings while ensuring your data remains under your control.

All of this is built on a platform-independent technology stack that runs seamlessly on Mac, Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS.

## 9. Future Directions

Bodhi App's architecture is designed not only to serve as a local LLM Resource Server today but also to evolve:

- **Expanding Modalities:**  
  While the current focus is on LLM inference (chat generation, etc.), the platform is well-positioned to expand into additional areas such as:
  - **Text-to-Image Generation**
  - **Text-to-Audio/Speech Synthesis**
  - **Speech-to-Text Transcription**

- **Enhanced Analytics & Monitoring:**  
  Future iterations may incorporate detailed usage analytics, performance metrics, and more granular caching strategies to further optimize both security and performance.

- **Broader AI Ecosystem Integration:**  
  As the platform evolves into a GenAI Resource Server, it may include additional endpoints and integration mechanisms, thereby strengthening its role as the central node in a diverse AI ecosystem.
