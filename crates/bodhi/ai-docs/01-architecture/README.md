# Architecture Documentation

This section contains technical architecture documentation for the Bodhi App, including system design, component architecture, and integration patterns.

## Contents

### Core Architecture
- **[App Overview](app-overview.md)** - Complete system architecture, data flows, and design patterns
- **[Frontend Architecture](frontend-architecture.md)** - React+Vite frontend architecture and component organization
- **[Tauri Desktop Architecture](tauri-architecture.md)** - Desktop application architecture and native integration
- **[Backend Integration](backend-integration.md)** - API integration patterns and state management
- **[Authentication](authentication.md)** - Authentication system design and implementation

### Design & Development
- **[Design System & Components](design-system.md)** - Design system foundations and component library
- **[Development Conventions](conventions.md)** - Coding standards and best practices
- **[App Status System](app-status.md)** - Application state machine and status management



## Architecture Principles

### Frontend Architecture
- **React+Vite** - Modern React development with Vite build system
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Component-based** - Modular, reusable UI components
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance and screen reader support

### Backend Integration
- **RESTful APIs** - Standard HTTP API patterns
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket connections for live data
- **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses and recovery
- **Authentication** - OAuth2 and JWT token management
- **Data Validation** - Input validation and sanitization

### System Design
- **Modular Architecture** - Loosely coupled components
- **Scalable Design** - Horizontal and vertical scaling support
- **Performance Optimization** - Efficient resource utilization
- **Security First** - Security considerations in all design decisions
- **Maintainability** - Clean code and documentation standards

## Key Technologies

### Frontend Stack
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui component library
- React Query for data fetching
- React Router for navigation

### Development Tools
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Vitest for testing
- MSW for API mocking
- Husky for git hooks

### Integration Points
- HuggingFace API for model metadata
- Local LLM inference engines
- File system for model storage
- WebSocket for real-time updates

## Documentation Standards

### Architecture Documents Should Include
1. **Purpose and Scope** - What the component does
2. **Design Decisions** - Why specific choices were made
3. **Implementation Details** - How it's built
4. **Integration Points** - How it connects to other components
5. **Performance Considerations** - Scalability and optimization
6. **Security Considerations** - Security implications and mitigations
7. **Future Considerations** - Planned improvements and extensions

### Diagram Standards
- Use Mermaid for system diagrams
- Include component interaction flows
- Show data flow and dependencies
- Maintain consistent notation

### Code Examples
- Include TypeScript interfaces
- Show implementation patterns
- Provide usage examples
- Include error handling patterns

## Contributing

When adding architecture documentation:

1. **Follow the template structure** for consistency
2. **Include diagrams** where helpful for understanding
3. **Document design decisions** and rationale
4. **Update integration points** when adding new components
5. **Consider security implications** in all designs
6. **Include performance considerations** for scalability

## Maintenance

Architecture documentation should be updated when:
- New components are added
- Integration patterns change
- Performance characteristics change
- Security requirements evolve
- Technology stack updates occur
