# API Authorization Feature

## Requirements

### User Story
As a System Administrator  
I want to enforce role-based access control on API endpoints  
So that users can only access resources appropriate for their role level

### Core Requirements

#### Role Hierarchy
- Roles are hierarchical in descending order: admin > manager > power_user > user
  1. Admin (`resource_admin`)
  2. Manager (`resource_manager`)
  3. Power User (`resource_power_user`)
  4. User (`resource_user`)
- Higher roles automatically have access to lower role endpoints
- Role hierarchy must be implemented as a reusable function
- Roles are included in JWT token claims resource_access
- Each endpoint is configured with minimum required role level

#### Token Scope Hierarchy
- TokenScope similar to Role are hierarchical in descending order: admin > manager > power_user > user
  1. Admin (`scope_token_admin`)
  2. Manager (`scope_token_manager`)
  3. Power User (`scope_token_power_user`)
  4. User (`scope_token_user`)
- Higher TokenScope automatically have access to lower role endpoints
- TokenScope hierarchy must be implemented as a reusable function
- TokenScope are included in JWT token claims "scope"
- A TokenScope JTW should also have scope "offline_access"
- No configuration file needed for hierarchy
- Each endpoint is configured with minimum required TokenScope level
- API call with TokenScope will not have access to authorized endpoints not configured with TokenScope level 

#### Common
- No configuration file needed for Role or TokenScope hierarchy
- No customizations possible for Role or TokenScope hierarchy
- All checks skipped in non-authenticated mode

#### Token Claim Extraction
- Session tokens: validate roles in resource_access.[client-id].roles
- Client ID in resource_access must match app's client ID
- Bearer tokens: validate TokenScope in scope claim (e.g., scope_token_user)
- Bearer tokens: should also have scope `offline_access`, otherwise not parsed
- Rely solely on token claims for role validation
- Authorization must be enforced after authentication

#### Authorization Flow
1. Auth middleware injects active access token in header
2. API auth middleware extracts role information:
   - For Session tokens: Check `resource_access.[client-id].roles` array and inject the role in header `X-Resource-Role`
   - For Bearer tokens: Check `scope` field for token-scope-specific claims and inject the token scope in header `X-Resource-Token-Scope`
3. At API endpoints, validate minimum required role or token_scope access
4. Allow or deny request with appropriate response

#### Security Requirements
- Return 403 Forbidden for insufficient privileges
- Use generic error message without disclosing required role
- Log authorization failures at WARN level
- Include request path in warning logs
- Skip role checks in non-authenticated mode
- Token claims must include valid client ID

#### User Interface Requirements
1. Non-authenticated Mode
   - Show message "App needs to be in authenticated mode for this feature"
   - Skip role validation checks
   - Display clear explanation of non-authenticated mode behavior

2. Error Handling
   - Generic error message for insufficient privileges
   - Localized using FluentLocalizationService
   - No disclosure of required roles in error messages
   - Clear feedback for authorization failures

### Not In Scope
- Custom role definitions
- Role management interface
- Role-based UI components
- Role access tracking/analytics
- Multiple explicit roles per route
- Real-time role updates
- Custom role assignments
- Audit logging of successful access

## Technical Details

### Authorization Types

1. **Role-Based (Session)**
```rust
pub enum Role {
    User,
    PowerUser,
    Manager,
    Admin,
}

impl Role {
    fn has_access_to(&self, required: &Role) -> bool {
        // Implement hierarchy check
    }
}

let admin_apis = Router::new().route("/api/settings", get(settings_handler))
   .route("/api/admin", get(admin_handler))
   .route_layer(from_fn_with_state(state.clone(), api_auth_middleware(Some(Role::Admin), None)));
let manager_apis = Router::new().route("/api/users",
    get(user_handler))
   .route("/api/billing",
    get(billing_handler))
    .route_layer(from_fn_with_state(state.clone(), api_auth_middleware(Some(Role::Manager), Some(TokenScope::Manager))));
let app_router = admin_apis.merge(manager_apis).merge(...);
```

### Token Claims Structure
```json
{
  "resource_access": {
    "resource-71425db3-e706-42d6-b254-81b2e9820346": {
      "roles": [
        "resource_manager",
        "resource_power_user",
        "resource_user",
        "resource_admin"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Token Scope-Based (API Token)**
```rust
pub enum TokenScope {
    User,
    PowerUser,
    Manager,
    Admin,
}
```

### Bearer Token Scope
```json
scope: "openid offline_access scope_token_user"
```

### Route Authorization Matrix

**role=anon** (No Authentication Required)
```
GET  /ping
GET  /app/info
GET  /app/setup
GET  /app/login
GET  /app/login/callback
POST /api/ui/logout
GET  /api/ui/user
GET  /* (UI fallback routes)
```

**role=user & scope=scope_token_user**
```
GET   /api/ui/models
GET   /api/ui/models/:id
POST  /v1/chat/completions
GET   /api/tags                    # Ollama models list
POST  /api/show                    # Ollama model show
POST  /api/chat                    # Ollama chat
GET   /api/ui/chats
GET   /api/ui/chats/:id
POST  /api/ui/chats
PUT   /api/ui/chats/:id
```

**role=power_user**
- should only be allowed to access (list) and update his own tokens
```
POST /api/ui/tokens             # Create token (session only)
POST /api/ui/create             # Create operations (session only)
PUT  /api/ui/create/:id         # (session only)
```

**role=power_user or scope=scope_token_power_user**
```
GET  /api/ui/pull              # Pull operations
POST /api/ui/pull
```

**role=manager**
- should be allowed to access and update app-wide tokens
```
GET  /api/ui/tokens            # List all tokens (session only)
GET  /api/ui/tokens/:id       # Get token details (session only)
PUT  /api/ui/tokens/:id      # Update token (session only)
```

**role=admin**
```
GET  /dev/secrets            # Only in non-production (session only)
```

### Implementation Notes

1. **Session vs Token Authorization**
- Session authentication uses Role enum
- API token authentication uses TokenScope enum
- Some operations restricted to session-only
- TokenScope cannot perform token management operations

2. **Hierarchy Implementation**
```rust
impl Role {
      fn has_access_to(&self, required: &Role) -> bool {
         // Session role hierarchy check
      }
}

impl TokenScope {
      fn has_access_to(&self, required: &TokenScope) -> bool {
         // Token scope hierarchy check
      }

}
```

3. **Token Claims**
   ```json
   {
     "scope": "offline_access scope_token_power_user",
     "resource_access": {
       "resource-id": {
         "roles": ["resource_power_user", "resource_user"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Authorization Flow**
- Check authentication type (session vs token)
- Apply appropriate authorization type
- Check additional restrictions for token-based auth
- Validate operation permissions

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Restrictions**
- API tokens cannot create other tokens
- API tokens cannot manage other tokens
- API tokens cannot access admin routes
- Some operations require session authentication

2. **Session Privileges**
- Full access based on role level
- Can perform token management
- Can access admin features
- No additional restrictions

## Migration Plan

   - Implement Role enum and hierarchy
   - Add token validation logic
   - Set up error handling

   - Verify error handling
   - Test performance and caching

5. Production rollout
