# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the `test_utils` module for HTTP server infrastructure.

*For implementation details and extension patterns, see [crates/server_core/src/test_utils/PACKAGE.md](crates/server_core/src/test_utils/PACKAGE.md)*

## Purpose

The `test_utils` module provides specialized testing infrastructure for BodhiApp's HTTP server infrastructure layer, enabling comprehensive testing of server-sent event streaming, LLM server context management, and HTTP route coordination with sophisticated mock orchestration.

## HTTP Infrastructure Testing Architecture

### RouterState Testing Foundation

- **router_state_stub()**: Pre-configured RouterState with MockSharedContext and AppServiceStub integration
- **Service Mock Coordination**: HTTP route testing with comprehensive service registry mocking
- **Context Management Testing**: LLM server context testing with lifecycle and state management validation
- **Error Propagation Testing**: HTTP error translation testing with service error coordination
- **Dependency Injection Testing**: RouterState dependency injection validation for HTTP handlers

### SharedContext Mock Orchestration
Advanced LLM server context testing with process coordination:
- **MockSharedContext**: Comprehensive LLM server context mocking for HTTP infrastructure testing
- **Server State Management**: LLM server lifecycle testing with state synchronization validation
- **Request Routing Testing**: Chat completion request routing through context management
- **Observer Pattern Testing**: Server state listener testing with notification coordination
- **Resource Lifecycle Testing**: LLM server startup/shutdown testing with proper cleanup validation

### Server-Sent Events Testing Infrastructure
Comprehensive SSE streaming testing for real-time communication:
- **DirectSSE Testing**: Application event streaming testing with BytesMut optimization validation
- **ForwardedSSE Testing**: LLM server proxy streaming testing with error handling validation
- **Connection Management Testing**: HTTP connection lifecycle testing with automatic cleanup

## Cross-Crate Testing Integration

### Services Layer HTTP Testing
HTTP infrastructure testing extensively coordinates with services testing:
- **AppServiceStub Integration**: HTTP testing uses services test utilities for realistic service coordination

### Routes Layer Testing Support
HTTP infrastructure testing provides foundation for route testing:
- **RouterState Injection**: HTTP route testing with dependency injection validation
- **SSE Response Testing**: Route streaming response testing with SSE infrastructure
- **Error Response Testing**: HTTP route error handling testing with infrastructure error translation
- **Service Access Testing**: Route service access testing through RouterState infrastructure
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end HTTP testing across infrastructure and route layers

## Architecture Position

The `test_utils` module serves as:
- **HTTP Infrastructure Testing Foundation**: Provides specialized testing for server-sent events and context management
