# NAPI-RS FFI Implementation - Continuation Prompt

## Current State Summary

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - NAPI-RS FFI Playwright UI testing implementation completed successfully.

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Embedded UI assets serving correctly through lib_bodhiserver
- ✅ App initializes in Ready state (not Setup state)
- ✅ Authentication configuration properly set with integration test values
- ✅ Clean dependency architecture (lib_bodhiserver_napi → lib_bodhiserver only)
- ✅ Playwright UI tests pass: homepage → /ui/login/ redirect working
- ✅ API endpoints functional (/ping returns 200 OK)
- ✅ Server lifecycle management working (start/stop)

**Test Results Verification:**
```bash
# API Test - All passing
cd examples/napi-test && npm run start

# UI Test - All passing (non-headless mode)
cd examples/napi-test && npm run test:ui:headed
```

## Critical Technical Debt (High Priority)

### 1. Hardcoded Authentication Configuration
**Current Issue**: Integration test credentials hardcoded in `crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi/src/app_initializer.rs:69-77`

**Security Risk**: Production deployment would use test credentials
**Required Action**: Implement environment-aware configuration system

**Reference Files:**
- `crates/integration-tests/tests/resources/.env.test` - Source of current values
- `crates/services/src/setting_service.rs` - Setting categories and management
- `crates/services/src/service_ext.rs` - SecretServiceExt for AppRegInfo storage

### 2. Manual Localization Service Initialization
**Current Issue**: Explicit setup required in NAPI bridge (`app_initializer.rs:53-54`)

**Architecture Violation**: lib_bodhiserver should handle this automatically
**Required Action**: Move localization setup into lib_bodhiserver build process

### 3. Missing Unified Configuration Management
**Current Issue**: Individual parameters instead of settings.yaml approach

**Impact**: Scattered configuration, difficult to manage environments
**Required Action**: Implement hierarchical configuration system

## Immediate Next Tasks (Prioritized)

### Task 1: Environment-Aware Authentication Configuration
**Objective**: Replace hardcoded credentials with configurable authentication setup

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Create `AppConfig::set_auth_config()` method accepting environment-specific values
2. Support multiple configuration sources (environment variables, config files, parameters)
3. Implement secure credential validation and error handling
4. Update NAPI interface to accept authentication configuration parameters

**Success Criteria:**
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Support for development, testing, and production environments
- Secure credential handling with proper validation

### Task 2: Automatic Localization Service Setup
**Objective**: Eliminate manual localization service initialization from NAPI bridge

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Move localization setup into `lib_bodhiserver::build_app_service()`
2. Ensure automatic initialization during app service creation
3. Remove manual setup from `app_initializer.rs`
4. Verify consistent localization across all deployment scenarios

**Success Criteria:**
- No manual localization setup required in NAPI bridge
- Automatic initialization during app service creation
- Consistent behavior across Tauri, NAPI, and other deployment modes

### Task 3: Comprehensive Error Handling
**Objective**: Implement robust error handling for production scenarios

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Add error scenarios to Playwright tests (network failures, invalid configs)
2. Implement proper error recovery and cleanup
3. Add structured logging for debugging
4. Create error handling documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- Graceful handling of common failure scenarios
- Proper resource cleanup on errors
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Architecture References

**Key Files to Understand:**
- `ai-docs/02-features/planned/20250615-napi-ffi-playwright-ui-testing.md` - Complete implementation specification
- `crates/lib_bodhiserver/src/app_service_builder.rs` - Service initialization patterns
- `crates/integration-tests/tests/utils/live_server_utils.rs` - Authentication configuration patterns
- `ai-docs/01-architecture/backend-development-conventions.md` - Development standards

**Current Working Implementation:**
- `crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi/src/app_initializer.rs` - Main NAPI bridge
- `crates/lib_bodhiserver/src/ui_assets.rs` - Embedded frontend assets
- `examples/napi-test/` - Working test project with Playwright tests

## Development Guidelines

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Always test both API and UI functionality after changes
2. Run tests in non-headless mode for visual verification
3. Verify app initializes in Ready state (status: 1)
4. Ensure authentication redirect works (/ → /ui/login/)

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Follow single dependency principle (lib_bodhiserver_napi → lib_bodhiserver only)
- Use workspace dependencies with `workspace = true`
- Implement proper error handling with thiserror patterns
- Add comprehensive re-exports to lib_bodhiserver for new dependencies

**Security Considerations:**
- Never commit hardcoded credentials
- Use environment-specific configuration
- Implement proper secret management patterns
- Follow OAuth 2.0 security best practices

## Success Metrics

**Technical Debt Resolution:**
- [ ] Zero hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] Automatic localization service initialization
- [ ] Unified configuration management system
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling coverage

**Production Readiness:**
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration support
- [ ] Secure credential management
- [ ] Complete test coverage (API + UI + error scenarios)
- [ ] Performance optimization and monitoring ready

**Architecture Quality:**
- [ ] Clean dependency boundaries maintained
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Configurable service implementations
- [ ] Documentation for deployment and configuration

## Important Notes

**Do Not Repeat Completed Work:**
- Embedded frontend assets are working correctly
- App state management is properly implemented
- Dependency architecture is clean and functional
- Basic Playwright UI testing is operational

**Focus Areas:**
- Configuration management and security
- Error handling and robustness
- Production readiness improvements
- Technical debt resolution

**Testing Verification:**
Always verify the working state before making changes:
```bash
cd examples/napi-test && npm run start  # Should show Ready state (1)
cd examples/napi-test && npm run test:ui:headed  # Should redirect to login
```

This foundation is production-ready for basic functionality. The next phase focuses on security, configuration management, and operational robustness.
