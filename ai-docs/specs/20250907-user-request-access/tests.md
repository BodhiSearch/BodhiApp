# Access Request Feature Consolidated Test Specifications

This document outlines the consolidated Playwright test specifications for the Access Request feature, designed to provide comprehensive coverage while minimizing test execution time and maintenance overhead.

## Test Consolidation Strategy

The 80+ granular test scenarios have been consolidated into **comprehensive multi-user flow tests** that validate complete user journeys in single test executions. This approach provides:

- **Better Integration Testing**: Tests real user workflows rather than isolated features
- **Reduced Test Execution Time**: Fewer server setups and teardowns
- **Improved Maintainability**: Shared fixtures and logical test organization
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Mirror actual production user journeys

## Primary Spec: Multi-User Request and Approval Flow

### Test File: `multi-user-request-approval-flow.spec.mjs`

This comprehensive test covers the complete access request lifecycle with multiple users and role hierarchy validation.

#### Test Setup
```javascript
test.beforeAll(async () => {
  // Create auth server with resource client
  // Make admin@email.com a resource admin
  // Setup clean test environment with no existing requests
});
