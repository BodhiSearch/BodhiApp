**Date:** 2025-10-09 15:43
**Status:** Completed

### Tasks Performed
1. Copied website files from bodhisearch.github.io to getbodhi.app/ using rsync
2. Installed npm dependencies successfully (541 packages)
3. Tested production build - completed successfully with 18 static pages generated
4. Verified build output directory and CNAME file
5. Staged all files to git (not committed per user preference)

### Verification Results
- [x] All source files copied successfully
- [x] npm install completed without errors (some deprecation warnings present but not blocking)
- [x] Production build succeeds with Next.js 14.2.22
- [x] Build output directory `out/` created with all assets
- [x] CNAME file present in both `public/` and `out/` with correct domain `getbodhi.app`
- [x] Asset URLs in HTML are root-relative (start with `/`)
- [x] Files staged in git (74 files, 11,035 insertions)
- [x] NO build artifacts staged (node_modules, .next, out, .git all excluded)

### Issues Encountered
None. All tasks completed successfully.

**Minor Notes:**
- npm install showed some deprecation warnings (eslint@8, inflight, glob@7, rimraf@3) but these are non-blocking
- 3 security vulnerabilities reported (1 low, 1 moderate, 1 critical) - these are inherited from the source repo and should be addressed separately if needed
- Browserslist outdated warning - also inherited from source repo

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: getbodhi.app/ (entire directory with 74 files)
- Staged in git: getbodhi.app/**

### Build Statistics
- Total packages: 541
- Static pages generated: 18
- First Load JS: 87.3 kB
- Build time: ~5 seconds
- Total staged changes: 11,035 insertions across 74 files

### Notes for Next Agent
- Phase 1 complete and fully verified
- Ready for Phase 2: Configure for Subpath Testing
- User should manually commit before Phase 2 begins
- Suggested commit message:
  ```
  Add getbodhi.app website to monorepo (Phase 1)

  - Copy all source files from bodhisearch.github.io
  - Verified local build works correctly
  - All 18 static pages generated successfully
  - No deployment yet - Phase 1 setup only
  ```
- Build artifacts are properly excluded from git via .gitignore
- CNAME file correctly preserved in build output
