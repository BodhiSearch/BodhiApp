## Agent Activity History

## Agent: Phase 1 Execution - Website Setup
**Date:** 2025-10-09 15:43
**Status:** Completed

### Tasks Performed
1. Copied website files from bodhisearch.github.io to getbodhi.app/ using rsync
2. Installed npm dependencies successfully (541 packages)
3. Tested production build - completed successfully with 18 static pages generated
4. Verified build output directory and CNAME file
5. Staged all files to git (not committed per user preference)

### Verification Results
- [x] All source files copied successfully
- [x] npm install completed without errors (some deprecation warnings present but not blocking)
- [x] Production build succeeds with Next.js 14.2.22
- [x] Build output directory `out/` created with all assets
- [x] CNAME file present in both `public/` and `out/` with correct domain `getbodhi.app`
- [x] Asset URLs in HTML are root-relative (start with `/`)
- [x] Files staged in git (74 files, 11,035 insertions)
- [x] NO build artifacts staged (node_modules, .next, out, .git all excluded)

### Issues Encountered
None. All tasks completed successfully.

**Minor Notes:**
- npm install showed some deprecation warnings (eslint@8, inflight, glob@7, rimraf@3) but these are non-blocking
- 3 security vulnerabilities reported (1 low, 1 moderate, 1 critical) - these are inherited from the source repo and should be addressed separately if needed
- Browserslist outdated warning - also inherited from source repo

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: getbodhi.app/ (entire directory with 74 files)
- Staged in git: getbodhi.app/**

### Build Statistics
- Total packages: 541
- Static pages generated: 18
- First Load JS: 87.3 kB
- Build time: ~5 seconds
- Total staged changes: 11,035 insertions across 74 files

### Notes for Next Agent
- Phase 1 complete and fully verified
- Ready for Phase 2: Configure for Subpath Testing
- User should manually commit before Phase 2 begins
- Suggested commit message:
  ```
  Add getbodhi.app website to monorepo (Phase 1)

  - Copy all source files from bodhisearch.github.io
  - Verified local build works correctly
  - All 18 static pages generated successfully
  - No deployment yet - Phase 1 setup only
  ```
- Build artifacts are properly excluded from git via .gitignore
- CNAME file correctly preserved in build output

## Agent: Phase 2 Execution - Subpath Configuration
**Date:** 2025-10-09 16:02
**Status:** Completed

### Tasks Performed
1. Modified next.config.mjs to add basePath: '/BodhiApp'
2. Moved public/CNAME to public/CNAME.backup (temporary removal for testing)
3. Tested build with basePath - verified URLs have correct /BodhiApp/ prefix
4. Created GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml) with manual trigger only
5. Staged all changes to git (not committed per user preference)

### Verification Results
- [x] basePath added to next.config.mjs (line 5, after output: 'export')
- [x] CNAME file backed up (moved to CNAME.backup, not in build output)
- [x] Build succeeds with basePath configuration (18 pages, ~5 seconds)
- [x] URLs in HTML have /BodhiApp/ prefix (verified with grep)
- [x] Asset paths (src="...") also prefixed correctly with /BodhiApp/
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow created (workflow_dispatch trigger only)
- [x] All changes staged in git (3 files: 1 modified, 1 renamed, 1 new)

### Issues Encountered
None. All tasks completed successfully.

**Minor Notes:**
- Build showed same deprecation warnings as Phase 1 (non-blocking)
- Build output includes CNAME.backup file (harmless) - Next.js copies all public/ files
- Git correctly detected CNAME → CNAME.backup as a rename operation
- No CNAME file in out/ directory (confirmed moved to backup)

### Build Results
- Build time: ~5 seconds
- Pages generated: 18 static pages
- First Load JS: 87.3 kB (unchanged from Phase 1)
- Asset URL examples from out/index.html:
  - `href="/BodhiApp/_next/static/media/e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2"`
  - `href="/BodhiApp/_next/static/css/2a8be090204fcb1f.css"`
  - `href="/BodhiApp/favicon.ico"`
  - `href="/BodhiApp/"`
  - `href="/BodhiApp/docs/"`
  - `src="/BodhiApp/_next/static/chunks/fd9d1056-877671e9694123b2.js"`
  - `src="/BodhiApp/_next/static/chunks/117-9aa179276ea19892.js"`

### Files Created/Modified
- Modified: getbodhi.app/next.config.mjs (added basePath: '/BodhiApp')
- Renamed: getbodhi.app/public/CNAME → getbodhi.app/public/CNAME.backup
- Created: .github/workflows/deploy-website.yml (67 lines)
- Total staged changes: 68 insertions across 3 files

### Notes for Next Agent (Phase 3)
- Phase 2 complete and fully verified
- Ready for Phase 3: Test Deployment to Subpath
- User should manually commit before Phase 3 begins
- Suggested commit message:
  ```
  Configure website for subpath testing (Phase 2)

  - Add basePath: '/BodhiApp' to Next.js config for testing
  - Temporarily remove CNAME (moved to CNAME.backup)
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow for Pages deployment
  - Manual trigger only (workflow_dispatch)
  - Ready for Phase 3: Test deployment to bodhisearch.github.io/BodhiApp
  ```
- Build is now configured for /BodhiApp/ subpath
- CNAME is backed up and will be restored in Phase 6 (final migration)
- Workflow uses workflow_dispatch only (manual trigger, no automatic deployments)
- All URLs and asset paths correctly prefixed with /BodhiApp/
- Build artifacts still excluded from git (node_modules, .next, out)

### Notes for User - Manual DNS Cutover Steps Required

**The code is ready for production deployment. User must now perform manual DNS cutover:**

**Suggested commit message:**
```
Configure website for production deployment

- Remove basePath: '/BodhiApp' (testing config no longer needed)
- Restore CNAME for getbodhi.app domain
- URLs now serve from root path
- Ready for DNS cutover to BodhiApp repo
```

**Manual Cutover Steps (perform in quick succession to minimize downtime):**

1. **Commit these changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Configure website for production deployment

   - Remove basePath: '/BodhiApp' (testing config no longer needed)
   - Restore CNAME for getbodhi.app domain
   - URLs now serve from root path
   - Ready for DNS cutover to BodhiApp repo"
   ```

2. **Disable old site (bodhisearch.github.io):**
   - Go to: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/bodhisearch.github.io/settings/pages
   - Click "Unpublish site" or disable GitHub Pages
   - This releases the custom domain claim on getbodhi.app

3. **Push changes to BodhiApp repo:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-website.yml
   ```
   Or manually trigger via GitHub UI: Actions → Deploy Website → Run workflow

5. **Configure custom domain in BodhiApp:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/BodhiApp/settings/pages
   - Under "Custom domain", enter: getbodhi.app
   - Click Save
   - Wait for DNS check to complete (may take 1-2 minutes)
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS" once DNS check passes

6. **Verify production deployment:**
   - Visit: https://getbodhi.app
   - Check homepage loads correctly
   - Navigate to docs: https://getbodhi.app/docs/
   - Verify all assets load (images, CSS, JS)
   - Check browser console for errors

**Expected Downtime:** 1-3 minutes between step 2 (unpublish old site) and step 6 (new site live)

**Critical:** Perform steps 2-6 in quick succession to minimize downtime

**Rollback Plan (if issues occur):**
- Re-enable GitHub Pages on bodhisearch.github.io repository
- Domain will automatically revert to old site
- Debug issues in BodhiApp repo without production impact

### Production Cutover Complete
- Code changes: DONE
- Staging: DONE
- Documentation: DONE
- Manual deployment steps: DOCUMENTED ABOVE
- User action required: Follow manual cutover steps 1-6
