# BodhiApp AI Gateway: Functional Capabilities Guide

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Audience**: Business Leaders, Product Managers, Team Leaders  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive overview of BodhiApp AI Gateway capabilities for mid-size organizations

---

## Executive Overview

BodhiApp AI Gateway transforms how growing companies manage their AI usage. Built specifically for organizations with 50-500 employees, it provides enterprise-level control and reliability without the complexity.

**Core Value Proposition:**
> "Give your entire team access to AI while maintaining complete control over costs, security, and performance."

### The Problem We Solve

Mid-size organizations face unique AI challenges:
- **No visibility** into who's using AI and how much it costs
- **No control** over spending - surprise bills are common
- **No reliability** - when OpenAI goes down, work stops
- **No collaboration** - teams work in silos, duplicating efforts
- **No optimization** - paying full price for every request

### Our Solution

A central command center for all your AI operations that:
- **Manages** access for your entire workforce
- **Controls** costs with budgets and limits
- **Ensures** reliability with automatic failover
- **Optimizes** spending through intelligent caching
- **Provides** complete visibility through analytics

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Team & Access Management

#### Organize Your Workforce

**Department Structure**
Create a logical hierarchy that mirrors your organization:
- **Departments** (Engineering, Marketing, Sales, Support)
- **Teams** within departments (Backend, Frontend, QA)
- **Individual users** with specific roles and permissions

**Access Control Made Simple**
- **Managers** approve new team members and set budgets
- **Team Leads** manage day-to-day access and monitor usage
- **Users** get personalized dashboards showing their consumption
- **Viewers** can monitor without making requests

**Self-Service Portal**
- Team members request access through a simple form
- Managers approve with one click
- Access automatically provisioned within minutes
- Departing employees automatically lose access

#### Virtual API Keys

**What They Are:**
Instead of sharing actual API keys, each team gets virtual keys that:
- Can be revoked instantly without affecting others
- Track usage to specific teams and users
- Automatically expire after set periods
- Work with multiple AI providers seamlessly

**How It Works:**
1. Admin creates virtual keys for each department
2. Teams use these keys instead of provider keys
3. All usage is tracked and attributed correctly
4. Keys can be rotated without changing code

---

### 2. Budget & Cost Management

#### Never Get Surprised by an AI Bill Again

**Multi-Level Budget Controls**

Set spending limits at every level:
- **Organization**: Total monthly AI budget ($10,000)
- **Department**: Engineering ($5,000), Marketing ($3,000)
- **Team**: Backend ($2,000), Frontend ($1,500)
- **Individual**: Each developer ($200/month)

**Smart Alert System**

Get notified before problems occur:
- **50% consumed**: Gentle reminder email
- **75% consumed**: Alert to manager via Slack
- **90% consumed**: Urgent notification to all stakeholders
- **100% reached**: Automatic blocking or throttling

**Flexible Enforcement Options**

Choose how to handle limit breaches:
- **Soft Limits**: Alert but allow continued usage
- **Hard Limits**: Block requests when limit reached
- **Smart Throttling**: Gradually reduce usage rate
- **Model Downgrade**: Switch to cheaper models automatically

**Cost Allocation & Reporting**

Track spending by any dimension:
- By department for budget planning
- By project for client billing
- By model for optimization opportunities
- By time period for trend analysis

---

### 3. Multi-Provider Support

#### Use Any AI Provider Without Lock-In

**Supported Providers**
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, DALL-E
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku
- **Google**: Gemini Pro, Vertex AI

---

### 4. Reliability & Performance

#### Keep Your AI Running 24/7

**Automatic Retry System**

Never let temporary failures stop your work:
- Automatically retry failed requests up to 3 times
- Smart delays between retries (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Cost-aware retries (stop if budget exceeded)
- Different strategies for different error types

**Intelligent Fallback Chains**

When one provider fails, automatically switch:
- **Primary**: Try GPT-4 first
- **Secondary**: Fall back to Claude if GPT-4 fails
- **Tertiary**: Use GPT-3.5 as last resort
- **Emergency**: Return cached or default response

**Smart Caching**

Dramatically reduce costs and improve speed:
- **Exact Match Cache**: Identical questions get instant responses
- **Semantic Cache**: Similar questions use cached answers
- **Team Sharing**: Common queries cached for entire team
- **Privacy Controls**: Sensitive data never cached

Cache benefits in practice:
- 35% of requests served from cache
- 10ms response time vs 2000ms
- $3,000+ monthly savings typical
- Zero additional setup required

**Circuit Breaker Protection**

Prevent cascade failures:
