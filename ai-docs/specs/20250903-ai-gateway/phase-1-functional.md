# BodhiApp AI Gateway - Phase 1: Team Management & Cost Control

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Launch Date**: Mid-September 2025  
**Target Users**: Teams of 5-50 people using AI APIs  
**Primary Goal**: Give teams control over AI usage and spending  

---

## What We're Building

In the next two weeks, we're transforming BodhiApp from a single-user AI tool into a team-ready platform with spending controls. This means your entire team can use AI safely without worrying about surprise bills or unauthorized usage.

### The Problem We're Solving

Currently, teams face these challenges:
- **No visibility**: Can't see who's using AI or how much
- **No control**: Anyone with an API key can spend unlimited amounts
- **No coordination**: Different team members use different AI providers
- **No protection**: One mistake can lead to a huge unexpected bill
- **No reliability**: When OpenAI fails, work stops

### Our Solution: Team Workspaces with Budget Controls

We're adding five essential capabilities:
1. **Team Workspaces** - Organize your team's AI usage in one place
2. **Usage Tracking** - See exactly who used what and when
3. **Budget Limits** - Set spending caps that actually work
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Understand your AI operations at a glance
5. **Automatic Retries** - Keep working even when providers have hiccups

## Feature Details

### 1. Team Workspaces

**What It Is:**
A workspace is your team's AI command center. It's where you manage who has access, what they can use, and how much they can spend.

**How It Works:**
- Create a workspace for your team (e.g., "Engineering Team" or "Marketing Department")
- Invite team members with specific roles
- All API usage is tracked to the workspace
- Leave the company? Lose access automatically

**User Roles:**
- **Owner**: Full control, can delete workspace
- **Admin**: Manage members and settings
- **Member**: Use AI within set limits

**Example Scenario:**
> Sarah creates an "Engineering" workspace and invites her 10 developers. She's the Owner, makes John an Admin to help manage settings, and the rest are Members who can use AI for coding tasks.

### 2. Usage Tracking & Visibility

**What It Is:**
Complete transparency into your team's AI usage - every request, every dollar, every user.

**What You'll See:**
- **Who**: Which team member made the request
- **What**: Which AI model they used (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **When**: Exact timestamp of each request
- **How Much**: Cost in dollars and tokens used
- **Why**: What project or task (if tagged)

**Example View:**
```
Today's Usage Summary:
- Total Requests: 247
- Total Cost: $12.43
- Most Active User: Alex (89 requests, $5.21)
- Most Used Model: GPT-3.5-turbo (183 requests)
- Peak Hour: 2-3 PM (45 requests)
```

**Benefits:**
- Identify heavy users who might need training
- Find cost-saving opportunities
- Audit usage for client billing
- Spot unusual activity immediately

### 3. Budget Limits & Alerts

**What It Is:**
Set spending limits that prevent budget overruns before they happen.

**How Limits Work:**
- **Monthly Budget**: Set maximum spending per month (e.g., $500)
- **Alert Threshold**: Get warned before hitting the limit (e.g., at 80%)
- **Automatic Enforcement**: Requests blocked when limit reached
- **Override Options**: Admins can temporarily increase limits if needed

**Alert Notifications:**
- **50% Used**: "Heads up - halfway through monthly budget"
- **80% Used**: "Warning - approaching budget limit"
- **90% Used**: "Urgent - only $50 remaining this month"
- **100% Reached**: "Budget exceeded - requests blocked"

**Example Configuration:**
> Marketing team sets $1,000/month budget with alerts at 80%. When they hit $800, managers get notified to either slow down usage or increase the budget.

**Smart Features:**
- Budgets reset automatically each month
- Unused budget doesn't roll over (use it or lose it)
- Different limits for different teams
- "Soft" limits that warn vs "hard" limits that block

### 4. Analytics Dashboard

**What It Is:**
A single screen showing everything you need to know about your team's AI usage.

**Dashboard Components:**

**Budget Status Card:**
- Visual progress bar showing spending
- Days remaining in billing period
- Current spending rate projection
- Alert if on track to exceed budget

**Daily Usage Chart:**
- Line graph of daily spending
- Identify usage patterns
- Spot anomalies quickly
- Compare weekday vs weekend usage

**Model Breakdown Pie Chart:**
- Which AI models cost the most
- Opportunities to use cheaper alternatives
- Compare quality vs cost trade-offs

**Team Leaderboard:**
- Top users by requests
- Top users by cost
- Most efficient users (value per dollar)
- Inactive members who have access

**Cost Trends:**
- Month-over-month comparison
- Spending by department
- Cost per employee metrics
- Savings from optimizations

**Example Insights:**
> "Your team spent 60% on GPT-4 but 90% of those requests could use GPT-3.5-turbo, saving $300/month"

### 5. Automatic Retry System

**What It Is:**
When an AI provider fails temporarily, BodhiApp automatically tries again so your work isn't interrupted.

**How It Helps:**
- **Rate Limit Errors**: Wait and retry automatically
- **Server Errors**: Try up to 3 times with smart delays
- **Network Issues**: Detect and retry connection problems
- **No Manual Work**: Happens invisibly in the background

**Smart Behavior:**
- First retry: Wait 1 second
- Second retry: Wait 2 seconds  
- Third retry: Wait 4 seconds
- Still failing? Return clear error message

**What This Prevents:**
- "OpenAI is down" stopping all work
- Rate limit errors killing automations
- Having to manually retry failed requests
- Lost productivity from temporary issues
