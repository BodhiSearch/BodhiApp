## Enhanced Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1: Team & Cost Management Foundation (4-6 weeks)
**Priority: CRITICAL - This is why customers buy**

#### 1.1 Team-Based Virtual Key System (Week 1-2)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Engineering uses GPT-4 for code review, Marketing uses Claude for content
- No visibility into who's spending what
- Shared API keys lead to security risks
- No way to revoke access when someone leaves

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct TeamVirtualKey {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub team_id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,
    pub provider: Provider,
    pub encrypted_credentials: Vec<u8>,
    pub permissions: TeamPermissions,
    pub quota: TeamQuota,
    pub members: Vec<UserId>,
    pub created_by: UserId,
    pub expires_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}

pub struct TeamPermissions {
    pub can_create_keys: bool,
    pub can_view_usage: bool,
    pub can_modify_limits: bool,
    pub max_model_tier: ModelTier, // e.g., "gpt-3.5" or "gpt-4"
}

pub struct TeamQuota {
    pub max_requests_per_day: Option<u32>,
    pub max_tokens_per_month: Option<u64>,
    pub max_cost_per_month: Option<Decimal>,
    pub alert_thresholds: Vec<f32>, // [0.5, 0.75, 0.9]
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Workspace Isolation**: Each team/department gets isolated workspace
- **Inheritance Model**: Organization → Department → Team → User limits
- **Self-Service**: Managers can provision keys within their quotas
- **Audit Trail**: Every key creation, modification, deletion logged
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Keys auto-expire, removed users lose access

**User Experience:**
1. Admin creates department workspace (Engineering, Marketing, Support)
2. Department heads set team budgets and model access
3. Team leads provision keys for their members
4. Users get personal dashboard showing their usage vs limits

#### 1.2 Budget & Cost Controls (Week 2-3)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Surprise $10K OpenAI bill at month end
- No warning when approaching limits
- Can't allocate costs to departments/projects
- No way to enforce spending limits

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct BudgetController {
    pub limits: BudgetLimits,
    pub alerts: AlertConfiguration,
    pub enforcement: EnforcementPolicy,
    pub tracking: UsageTracking,
}

pub struct BudgetLimits {
    pub cost_limit_usd: Decimal,
    pub token_limit: Option<u64>,
    pub reset_period: ResetPeriod,
    pub rollover: bool, // unused budget rolls to next period
}

pub enum ResetPeriod {
    Daily,
    Weekly { start_day: Weekday },
    Monthly { start_day: u8 },
    Quarterly,
}

pub struct AlertConfiguration {
    pub thresholds: Vec<f32>, // [0.5, 0.75, 0.9]
    pub channels: Vec<AlertChannel>,
    pub recipients: Vec<Recipient>,
    pub cooldown_minutes: u32, // avoid alert spam
}

pub enum EnforcementPolicy {
    Soft, // Alert only
    Hard, // Block requests
    Throttle { reduction_percent: f32 }, // Reduce rate
    Downgrade { to_model: String }, // Switch to cheaper model
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Sub-second cost calculation and limit checking
- **Multi-Level Alerts**: Email, Slack, in-app notifications
- **Flexible Enforcement**: Soft limits (warn) vs hard limits (block)
- **Smart Throttling**: Gradually reduce rate as limit approaches
- **Cost Allocation**: Tag requests with project/client codes

**Budget Hierarchy Example:**
```
Organization: $10,000/month
├── Engineering: $5,000/month (50%)
│   ├── Backend Team: $3,000/month
│   │   ├── John: $500/month
│   │   ├── Sarah: $500/month
│   │   └── Team Pool: $2,000/month
│   └── Frontend Team: $2,000/month
├── Marketing: $3,000/month (30%)
└── Reserve: $2,000/month (20%)
```

#### 1.3 Multi-Provider Support with Cost Optimization (Week 3-4)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Locked into single provider (usually OpenAI)
- No leverage for pricing negotiations
- Can't use best model for each use case
- Provider outages stop all AI usage

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct ProviderRegistry {
    pub providers: HashMap<ProviderId, ProviderConfig>,
    pub cost_table: CostTable,
    pub capabilities: CapabilityMatrix,
    pub health_status: HashMap<ProviderId, HealthStatus>,
}

pub struct ProviderConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub api_base: Url,
    pub auth: AuthMethod,
    pub models: Vec<ModelConfig>,
    pub rate_limits: RateLimits,
    pub cost_per_1k_tokens: CostTiers,
}

pub struct SmartProviderSelector {
    pub selection_strategy: SelectionStrategy,
    pub constraints: Vec<Constraint>,
}

pub enum SelectionStrategy {
    CostOptimized, // Cheapest provider for requirements
    QualityOptimized, // Best model available
    BalancedMode, // Cost/quality balance
    StickySession, // Same provider for conversation
}
```

**Supported Providers at Launch:**
1. **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5 (most popular)
2. **Anthropic**: Claude 3 family (best for analysis)
3. **Google Vertex**: Gemini Pro (good price/performance)
4. **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise compliance
5. **AWS Bedrock**: For AWS-heavy teams

**Provider Quick Switch:**
- One-click provider change in dashboard
- Automatic request transformation
- Side-by-side cost comparison
- "Try with different provider" button

#### 1.4 Team Access Control & Permissions (Week 4-5)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Everyone has same access level
- Can't restrict expensive models
- No approval workflow for high-cost requests
- Departing employees retain access

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct AccessControl {
    pub roles: Vec<Role>,
    pub policies: Vec<Policy>,
    pub approval_workflows: Vec<ApprovalWorkflow>,
}

pub enum Role {
    OrganizationAdmin, // Full control
    DepartmentManager, // Manage department resources
    TeamLead, // Manage team members
    Developer, // Use allocated resources
    Viewer, // Read-only access
}

pub struct ModelAccessPolicy {
    pub allowed_models: Vec<ModelId>,
    pub max_cost_per_request: Option<Decimal>,
    pub requires_approval: bool,
    pub approval_threshold: Decimal,
}
```

**Practical Permissions Model:**
- **Admins**: Manage billing, create departments
- **Managers**: Set team quotas, approve members
- **Users**: Consume within allocated limits
- **Viewers**: See dashboards, can't make requests

#### 1.5 Quick Start Templates (Week 5-6)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Don't know how to structure teams
- Uncertain about appropriate limits
- No best practices guidance
- Complex initial setup

**Our Solution - Department Templates:**

**Engineering Template:**
```yaml
name: "Engineering Department"
budget: "$5000/month"
teams:
  - name: "Development"
    budget: "$3000/month"
    default_model: "gpt-4"
    use_cases: ["code_review", "debugging", "documentation"]
  - name: "QA"
    budget: "$1000/month"
    default_model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    use_cases: ["test_generation", "bug_reports"]
  - name: "DevOps"
    budget: "$1000/month"
    default_model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    use_cases: ["script_generation", "troubleshooting"]
```

**Marketing Template:**
```yaml
name: "Marketing Department"
budget: "$3000/month"
teams:
  - name: "Content"
    budget: "$2000/month"
    default_model: "claude-3-sonnet"
    use_cases: ["blog_writing", "social_media"]
  - name: "SEO"
    budget: "$1000/month"
    default_model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    use_cases: ["keyword_research", "meta_descriptions"]
```

---

### Phase 2: Reliability & Performance Essentials (6-8 weeks)
**Priority: HIGH - Make it production-ready**

#### 2.1 Intelligent Retry System (Week 7-8)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Random API failures break production workflows
- No automatic recovery from transient errors
- Manual retry attempts waste developer time
- Costs multiply with blind retries

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct RetryStrategy {
    pub max_attempts: u8, // Default: 3
    pub backoff: BackoffStrategy,
    pub retry_conditions: Vec<RetryCondition>,
    pub cost_awareness: CostAwareRetry,
}

pub enum BackoffStrategy {
    Exponential { base_ms: u64, max_ms: u64 }, // 1s, 2s, 4s
    Linear { interval_ms: u64 },
    Smart { adapt_to_error: bool }, // Use retry-after headers
}

pub struct CostAwareRetry {
    pub max_retry_cost: Decimal,
    pub stop_if_budget_exceeded: bool,
    pub switch_to_cheaper_model: bool,
}

pub enum RetryCondition {
    StatusCode(Vec<u16>), // [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]
    Timeout,
    NetworkError,
    ProviderSpecific(String), // "rate_limit", "overloaded"
}
```

**Smart Retry Features:**
- **Error Classification**: Retryable vs permanent failures
- **Cost Protection**: Stop retries if approaching budget
- **Backoff Tuning**: Provider-specific optimal delays
- **Partial Success**: Save successful streaming chunks

**Real Example:**
```
Request to GPT-4 fails with 503
→ Wait 1 second, retry (attempt 2/3)
→ Fails again with 503
→ Wait 2 seconds, check budget (sufficient)
→ Retry with GPT-3.5-turbo as fallback (attempt 3/3)
→ Success! Log: "Succeeded after 2 retries with model downgrade"
```

#### 2.2 Multi-Level Fallback System (Week 8-9)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Provider outages halt all operations
- No graceful degradation options
- Can't balance cost vs availability
- Manual provider switching too slow

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct FallbackChain {
    pub strategies: Vec<FallbackStrategy>,
    pub trigger_conditions: Vec<TriggerCondition>,
    pub fallback_metrics: FallbackMetrics,
}

pub enum FallbackStrategy {
    ProviderFallback {
        chain: Vec<ProviderId>,
        preserve_model_tier: bool,
    },
    ModelDowngrade {
        from: ModelId,
        to: Vec<ModelId>,
    },
    CachedResponse {
        max_age_seconds: u64,
    },
    DefaultResponse {
        message: String,
    },
}

pub struct FallbackDecisionEngine {
    pub decision_factors: DecisionFactors,
    pub learning: bool, // Adapt based on success rates
}

pub struct DecisionFactors {
    pub error_type: f32,        // Weight: 0.4
    pub cost_impact: f32,       // Weight: 0.3
    pub user_priority: f32,     // Weight: 0.2
    pub time_of_day: f32,       // Weight: 0.1
}
```

**Fallback Examples:**

**Cost-Optimized Chain:**
```
1. GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI) - $0.002/1k tokens
2. Claude-3-haiku (Anthropic) - $0.003/1k tokens  
3. Gemini Pro (Google) - $0.005/1k tokens
4. Cached response (if available)
5. Default message: "AI temporarily unavailable"
```

**Quality-Optimized Chain:**
```
1. GPT-4 (OpenAI) - Premium
2. Claude-3-opus (Anthropic) - Premium
3. GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI) - Standard
4. Return error with manual escalation
```

#### 2.3 Practical Caching System (Week 9-10)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Same questions asked repeatedly
- Paying for identical API calls
- No sharing of common responses
- Cache invalidation complexity

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct CacheSystem {
    pub levels: Vec<CacheLevel>,
    pub invalidation: InvalidationStrategy,
    pub sharing: SharingPolicy,
}

pub enum CacheLevel {
    UserCache {
        ttl_seconds: u64, // Personal cache
    },
    TeamCache {
        ttl_seconds: u64, // Shared within team
    },
    OrganizationCache {
        ttl_seconds: u64, // Shared across org
        approval_required: bool,
    },
}

pub struct CacheKey {
    pub prompt_hash: String,
    pub model: ModelId,
    pub parameters: RequestParameters,
    pub context: Option<String>, // For semantic matching
}

pub struct CacheEntry {
    pub response: String,
    pub cost_saved: Decimal,
    pub hit_count: u32,
    pub created_by: UserId,
    pub expires_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

**Cache Strategy by Use Case:**

| Use Case | Cache Level | TTL | Sharing |
|----------|------------|-----|---------|
| Code completion | User | 1 hour | Private |
| Documentation query | Team | 24 hours | Team |
| Company FAQ | Organization | 7 days | All |
| Real-time data | None | - | - |

**Cache Benefits Tracking:**
- Daily cache hit rate: 35% average
- Cost saved: $3,000/month
- Response time: 10ms vs 2000ms
- Show savings on dashboard

#### 2.4 Circuit Breaker & Health Monitoring (Week 11-12)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Cascading failures during outages
- No automatic recovery
- Wasting requests on dead providers
- No visibility into provider health

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct CircuitBreaker {
    pub state: CircuitState,
    pub failure_threshold: u32, // 5 failures
    pub success_threshold: u32, // 2 successes to reset
    pub timeout: Duration, // 30 seconds cooldown
    pub half_open_requests: u32, // 1 test request
}

pub enum CircuitState {
    Closed, // Normal operation
    Open { since: Instant }, // Blocking requests
    HalfOpen { test_requests: u32 }, // Testing recovery
}

pub struct HealthMonitor {
    pub checks: Vec<HealthCheck>,
    pub dashboard: HealthDashboard,
    pub alerts: HealthAlerts,
}

pub struct ProviderHealth {
    pub availability: f32, // 99.9%
    pub average_latency_ms: u64,
    pub error_rate: f32,
    pub last_error: Option<ErrorInfo>,
}
```

**Circuit Breaker in Action:**
```
Provider: OpenAI GPT-4
├── 3 failures in 60 seconds → Circuit Opens
├── Block all requests for 30 seconds
├── After 30s → Send 1 test request
├── Test succeeds → Circuit Half-Open
├── Next 2 requests succeed → Circuit Closes
└── Resume normal operation
```

**Health Dashboard Shows:**
- Real-time provider status (green/yellow/red)
- 24-hour availability percentage
- Response time trends
- Current circuit breaker states

#### 2.5 Request Timeout Management (Week 12-13)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Hung requests blocking operations
- No timeout causes infinite waits
- Different endpoints need different timeouts
- No graceful timeout handling

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct TimeoutConfig {
    pub default_timeout_ms: u64, // 10000ms
    pub model_specific: HashMap<ModelId, u64>,
    pub operation_specific: HashMap<Operation, u64>,
    pub streaming_chunk_timeout_ms: u64, // 5000ms
}

pub struct TimeoutHandler {
    pub on_timeout: TimeoutAction,
    pub partial_response: bool, // Save partial streaming data
}

pub enum TimeoutAction {
    Retry { with_shorter_prompt: bool },
    Fallback { to_faster_model: bool },
    ReturnPartial,
    ReturnError,
}
```

**Timeout Presets:**
- **Quick**: 5 seconds (chat, simple queries)
- **Standard**: 10 seconds (most operations)
- **Extended**: 30 seconds (complex analysis)
- **Streaming**: 5 seconds between chunks

---

### Phase 3: Team Productivity Features (4-5 weeks)

#### 3.2 Smart Conditional Routing (Week 15-16)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Different teams need different models
- Time-based routing for cost optimization
- Priority handling for critical requests
- Manual routing configuration too complex

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct RoutingEngine {
    pub rules: Vec<RoutingRule>,
    pub evaluation: EvaluationStrategy,
    pub learning: AdaptiveLearning,
}

pub struct RoutingRule {
    pub condition: Condition,
    pub action: RoutingAction,
    pub priority: u32,
}

pub enum Condition {
    TeamBased { team_id: Uuid },
    TimeBased { schedule: TimeSchedule },
    UserAttribute { attribute: String, value: String },
    RequestSize { tokens: TokenRange },
    Metadata { key: String, value: String },
}

pub struct RoutingAction {
    pub provider: ProviderId,
    pub model: ModelId,
    pub max_cost: Option<Decimal>,
}
```

**Pre-Built Routing Templates:**

**Business Hours Optimization:**
```yaml
rules:
  - condition: 
      time: "09:00-17:00 Mon-Fri"
      team: "any"
    action:
      model: "gpt-4"
      reason: "Best quality during work hours"
  
  - condition:
      time: "17:00-09:00 or Weekend"
      team: "any"
    action:
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
      reason: "Cost savings after hours"
```

**Team-Based Routing:**
```yaml
rules:
  - condition:
      team: "customer-support"
    action:
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
      max_response_time: 2000ms
      
  - condition:
      team: "engineering"
    action:
      model: "gpt-4"
      allow_fallback: true
```

#### 3.3 User & Team Rate Limiting (Week 16-17)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Power users consume entire budget
- No fair resource allocation
- API abuse from scripts/bugs
- Need surge capacity for deadlines

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct RateLimiter {
    pub limits: Vec<RateLimit>,
    pub burst_handling: BurstPolicy,
    pub exceptions: Vec<Exception>,
}

pub struct RateLimit {
    pub scope: RateLimitScope,
    pub limit: Limit,
    pub window: TimeWindow,
    pub action: LimitAction,
}

pub enum RateLimitScope {
    User(UserId),
    Team(TeamId),
    Organization,
    Model(ModelId),
}

pub struct Limit {
    pub requests: Option<u32>,
    pub tokens: Option<u64>,
    pub cost_usd: Option<Decimal>,
}

pub struct BurstPolicy {
    pub allow_burst: bool,
    pub burst_multiplier: f32, // 1.5x normal limit
    pub burst_duration_minutes: u32, // 15 minutes
    pub cooldown_minutes: u32, // 60 minutes
}
```

**Practical Rate Limits:**

**Standard User Limits:**
- 100 requests/hour
- 100K tokens/day
- $50/day spend limit
- 2x burst for 15 minutes (once per day)

**Team Aggregate Limits:**
- 1000 requests/hour (all members combined)
- 1M tokens/day
- $500/day spend limit
- Can borrow from next day (with approval)

**Smart Throttling:**
```
User approaching limit (80%): Warning notification
User at limit (100%): Soft block with override request
User exceeding limit (>100%): Hard block
Manager approval: Temporary limit increase
```

#### 3.4 Collaboration Features (Week 17-18)

**The Problem We're Solving:**

### Phase 4: Cost Optimization & Intelligence (4-5 weeks)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Maximize value**

#### 4.1 Semantic Caching System (Week 19-20)

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Similar questions asked differently
- Cache misses on paraphrased queries
- No learning from past interactions
- Manual cache key management

**Our Solution:**
```rust
pub struct SemanticCache {
    pub embedding_model: EmbeddingModel,
    pub similarity_threshold: f32, // 0.85
    pub vector_store: VectorStore,
    pub privacy_mode: PrivacyMode,
}

pub struct SemanticMatch {
    pub query_embedding: Vec<f32>,
    pub cached_entries: Vec<CachedEntry>,
    pub similarity_scores: Vec<f32>,
    pub best_match: Option<CachedEntry>,
}

pub enum PrivacyMode {
    Strict, // No cross-user matching
    Team, // Match within team only
    Organization, // Match across org
}

pub struct SemanticCacheStats {
    pub hit_rate: f32, // 45% with semantic
    pub cost_saved: Decimal,
