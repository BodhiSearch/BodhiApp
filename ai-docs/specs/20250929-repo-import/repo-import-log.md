## 2025-09-29 - Phase 2: OpenAPI Specification Trimming

### Phase 2 Activities Completed

#### 1. Trim Script Creation
**Created `/Users/amir36/Documents/workspace/src/github.com/BodhiSearch/BodhiApp/crates/async-openai/scripts/trim_openapi.js`:**
- Manual trimming approach using js-yaml library
- Filters OpenAPI spec to only required endpoints
- Preserves all component schemas for type completeness
- **Status**: ✓ COMPLETED

#### 2. Node.js Environment Setup
```bash
cd crates/async-openai
npm init -y
npm install js-yaml
```
- **Result**: Created package.json with js-yaml@4.1.0 dependency
- **Status**: ✓ COMPLETED

#### 3. OpenAPI Endpoint Discovery
**Initial script attempted to find `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`:**
- Found 0 endpoints with `/v1/` prefix
- **Issue identified**: OpenAPI spec uses paths without `/v1/` prefix

**Corrected endpoint discovery:**
```bash
node -e "const yaml = require('js-yaml'); const fs = require('fs'); const spec = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync('openapi.yaml', 'utf8')); console.log('Available paths:', Object.keys(spec.paths || {}).filter(p => p.includes('chat') || p.includes('embed')).sort());"
```
- **Found endpoints**: `/chat/completions`, `/embeddings` (plus related paths)
- **Status**: ✓ COMPLETED

#### 4. Script Correction and Execution
**Updated trim_openapi.js to use correct endpoint paths:**
- Changed from `/v1/chat/completions` to `/chat/completions`
- Changed from `/v1/embeddings` to `/embeddings`

```bash
cd crates/async-openai/scripts
node trim_openapi.js
```
- **Output**:
  ```
  Trimmed spec saved to openapi-trim.json
  Included endpoints: [ '/chat/completions', '/embeddings' ]
  Components count: 477
  ```
- **Status**: ✓ COMPLETED

#### 5. Verification Steps
```bash
# Verify trimmed spec contains only desired endpoints
jq '.paths | keys' openapi-trim.json
# Output: [ "/chat/completions", "/embeddings" ]

# Count components in trimmed spec
jq '.components.schemas | keys | length' openapi-trim.json
# Output: 477

# Check file size
ls -lh openapi-trim.json
# Output: -rw-r--r--@ 1 amir36  staff   937K Sep 29 19:45 openapi-trim.json

# Compare with original
ls -lh openapi.yaml
# Output: -rw-r--r--@ 1 amir36  staff   1.3M Sep 29 19:41 openapi.yaml

# Count original endpoints
node -e "const yaml = require('js-yaml'); const fs = require('fs'); const spec = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync('openapi.yaml', 'utf8')); console.log(Object.keys(spec.paths || {}).length);"
# Output: 99
```
- **All verification steps passed**: ✓ COMPLETED

### Phase 2 Results Summary
- **Original OpenAPI specification**: 99 endpoints, 1.3MB, 477 component schemas
- **Trimmed OpenAPI specification**: 2 endpoints, 937KB, 477 component schemas
- **Endpoint reduction**: 97 endpoints removed (97.98% reduction)
- **File size reduction**: 32% smaller (1.3MB → 937KB)
