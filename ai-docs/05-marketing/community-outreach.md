Hey everyone! üëã

Thanks for joining the Bodhi App demo yesterday! Here's the presentation slides üìä

For those who missed joining our WhatsApp Beta Users group, here is link you can use - https://chat.whatsapp.com/BxImzMllvLrIMYEOxVZYY9

We are rolling out pretty amazing features in March-April -
- Windows App
- Linux App
- Support for Nvidia CUDA GPUs
- Support for AMD ROCm GPUs

We need volunteers to smoke test our build on these platforms. So if you are interested please join the WhatsApp group and share your machine specs, I will share the compatibility test suite that you can run on your machine and submit the report. This will be a big help.

üéâ Incredibly grateful for the enriching experience at Latent Space! A huge thank you to @ for putting together such an insightful event.

I had the privilege of demonstrating @ - our open-source AI development platform that brings local LLMs to Mac (and soon Windows & Linux!). The engagement and feedback from fellow developers and AI enthusiasts was truly energizing! 

What resonated most:
‚Ä¢ The growing demand for privacy-focused AI solutions
‚Ä¢ The excitement around local LLM development
‚Ä¢ The strong interest in cross-platform compatibility

üîç Curious about Bodhi App?
‚Ä¢ Run any LLM locally on your machine
‚Ä¢ Privacy-first approach
‚Ä¢ Non-tech friendly UI 
‚Ä¢ Developer-centric with OpenAI and Ollama API compatability

We're looking for tech enthusiasts and developers to help test Bodhi App's compatibility across different hardware configurations. This is your chance to be part of democratizing AI development!

What we're testing:
‚Ä¢ Windows compatibility
‚Ä¢ Linux support
‚Ä¢ NVIDIA CUDA optimization
‚Ä¢ AMD ROCm support

üõ†Ô∏è How you can help:
1. Run our compatibility test suite
2. Submit hardware compatibility reports
3. Help shape the future of local LLM development

We've open-sourced our compatibility testing framework:
https://github.com/BodhiSearch/llama-server-compat-tests

Your questions and insights are helping shape our roadmap. We're committed to making AI development more accessible and efficient for everyone.
