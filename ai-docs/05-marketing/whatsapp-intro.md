ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone! A few of you have pinged me via DM, so thought will introduce myself properly and get connected with some of you if our interests match.
I'm Amir, bringing 18+ years of tech experience including leadership roles at Gojek (VP Mobile, Data Engineering, DevOps) and ThoughtWorks. 

My AI journey started with Jeremy Howard's deep learning courses, focusing on computer vision and LLMs. Previously founded a startup working on Stable Diffusion (created fantasy profile pictures) and have a Udemy course on the technology http://bit.ly/intro2sd .

Currently, I'm building Bodhi App - an open-source platform in Rust that lets you run LLMs locally. Been deeply involved in AI-assisted development, using GitHub Copilot since launch and Cursor for the past 9 months, so vibe coding Bodhi App even before the term was coined.

At Bodhi App, our vision is to democratize AI access to everyone on the planet. As first step, we are doing this by allowing you to run LLMs on your local machine. 

As my prime audience, I am looking to connect with:
â€¢ Students from IITs, NITs
â€¢ Law school students
â€¢ CS/CA schools
â€¢ Tech workers
looking to get started with AI and AI-enable themselves with this future approaching towards us so quickly.

Currently Bodhi App is fully functional for MacOS. For Linux and Windows, we are finalizing our inference engine compatability. Given variety of CPU and GPU configuration it has been a challenge.
