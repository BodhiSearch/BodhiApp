## PRODUCT HUNT LAUNCH - "What's New in This Version?"

This major update introduces web AI integration capabilities that allow websites and Chrome extensions to connect directly to your local LLM inference server through standard HTTP APIs. We've implemented OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693) enabling secure cross-client authentication, so third-party applications can safely access your local AI server while maintaining enterprise-grade security through Keycloak integration. The release includes a TypeScript client library (@bodhiapp/ts-client) for seamless developer integration, enhanced multi-user authentication with role-based access control, and significant performance improvements including 60% faster startup times and 40% memory usage reduction. Additionally, we've expanded platform support to include macOS, Windows, and Linux, while implementing production-grade FFI through NAPI-RS for robust JavaScript integration. These updates transform Bodhi App from a local AI tool into foundational Web 4.0 infrastructure, enabling any web application or browser extension to harness local AI inference with complete privacy, zero ongoing costs, and lightning-fast responses without cloud dependency.
