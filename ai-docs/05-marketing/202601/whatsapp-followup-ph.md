## About Product Hunt Pre-Launch Reviews

Product Hunt's review link allows supporters to write reviews BEFORE the official launch. Here's how it works:

**The Strategy:**
1. Share review link with early supporters (Thursday-Sunday before Monday launch)
2. Supporters try the demo and write honest reviews
3. Reviews are held pending until launch
4. Reviews go live automatically when product launches Monday 1:31 PM IST
5. Product starts with social proof from day one = better ranking signals

**Benefits:**
- Instant credibility when product goes live (reviews already there)
- Early engagement signals help Product Hunt ranking algorithm
- Saves supporters time on launch day (just upvote/comment, review already done)
- Shows product is real and used (not just hype)

**Best Timing to Ask:**
- **Thursday/Friday (Jan 30-31):** Gives people weekend to try + review (IDEAL)
- **Saturday/Sunday (Feb 1):** Still good, urgency builds
- **Monday morning:** Too late - you want reviews live when you launch at 1:31 PM IST

**Important:**
- Ask for HONEST reviews (Product Hunt values authenticity)
- Test with 2-3 close supporters first to verify reviews don't publish immediately
- Don't spam - one follow-up message per person/group maximum

## Usage Guidelines

**Pre-Launch Timing (Before Monday, Feb 2):**
- **Best:** Send Thursday/Friday (Jan 30-31) - gives people weekend to try + review
- **Good:** Send Saturday/Sunday (Feb 1) - still time before Monday launch
- **Avoid:** Sending Monday morning - too late for pre-launch reviews to help
- Stagger across groups (15-30 min apart)

**Why Pre-Launch Reviews Matter:**
- Reviews go live when product launches Monday 1:31 PM IST
- Starting with reviews = instant social proof
- Helps ranking algorithm (early engagement signals quality)
- Builds momentum from minute one

**Which Version to Use:**
- **Version 1:** Quick minimal ask (busy people, already engaged)
- **Version 2:** General developer groups, balanced context
- **Version 3:** Close friends/supportive community (direct personal ask + urgency)
- **Version 4:** Technical/React developer groups (architecture focus)
- **Version 5:** Groups that need value reminder (may have forgotten first message)
- **Version 6:** Collaborative groups where you asked for app ideas originally
- **Version 7:** Pre-launch momentum (urgency framing, best for Thursday/Friday send)
- **Version 8:** Deep technical/architecture-focused groups

**Best Practices:**
- **Emphasize "review goes live Monday"** - clarifies why reviewing now helps
- **Keep brief** - they already know about Bodhi Chat
- **Clear ask:** Try demo + write review now
- **Provide direct links** - demo + review link
- **Thank genuinely** - early supporters are valuable
- **Don't send more than 1 follow-up** per person/group

**Avoid:**
- Sending too close to original message (wait at least 1-2 days)
- Repeating all product details (wastes their time)
- Unclear timing ("we're launching soon" - be specific: "Monday Feb 2")
- Guilt-tripping language ("I know you're busy but...")
- Multiple follow-ups to same person/group
- Generic "please support" without explaining the pre-launch review benefit

**Note on Product Hunt Pre-Launch Reviews:**
This feature allows reviews to be submitted before launch. Reviews appear when product goes live on Monday. Test with a few close supporters first to verify behavior, then expand outreach.

## Research Notes on Pre-Launch Review Feature

**What We Know:**
- Review link format: `/products/[product-name]/reviews/new`
- Link works before product goes live
- Likely holds reviews in pending state until launch

**What We Don't Know (Test First):**
- Do reviews publish immediately or wait until launch? (Test with 1-2 people first)
- Can reviewers edit reviews after submission?
- Is there a limit to pre-launch reviews?
- Do reviewers get notified when product goes live?

**Recommended Testing:**
1. **Thursday:** Send to 2-3 very close supporters
2. **Verify:** Reviews don't appear publicly yet
3. **Friday-Sunday:** If verified, send to broader network
4. **Monday 1:30 PM IST:** Check if reviews went live automatically at launch

**Conservative Messaging (if unsure):**
"You can write a review now using this link. Your review will appear when we officially launch Monday."

This feature isn't extensively documented in Product Hunt's official guides (as of 2026), so conservative approach recommended until verified through testing.
