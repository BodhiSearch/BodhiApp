# WhatsApp Snippets for Bodhi Chat Launch

## Version 1: HN Focus (Short)

Hey folks 👋

Been working on something for local LLM users - posted on HN about it.

**Bodhi App** - like Ollama, but with OAuth 2.1 security. Web apps can securely access your local model's APIs with your consent.

**Bodhi Chat** - PoC static site showing what's possible. Deep research + web search, all running on your machine.

Built **bodhi-js SDK** for devs to create apps on this pattern.

Would appreciate an upvote if interesting:

Looking for app ideas using local LLMs (inference, embeddings, RAG, search). DM if you have thoughts!

## Version 2: LinkedIn Focus (Short)

Hey everyone 👋

Shared a write-up on LinkedIn about bringing your own AI model to web apps.

**Bodhi App** - OAuth 2.1 secured local LLM server. Any web app can access your model's APIs with your permission.

**Bodhi Chat** - demo on GitHub Pages. Deep research agent running entirely on your machine.

Check out **bodhi-js SDK** to build your own apps.

Would love your thoughts/share:

## Version 3: Both Links (Medium)

Hey folks 👋

Been working on Bodhi App - runs local LLMs with OAuth 2.1 security, letting web apps access your model's APIs with your consent.

Built **bodhi-js** SDK for React devs. Wrap your app in `<BodhiProvider>` and get OpenAI-compatible client + auth handled.

**Bodhi Chat** is the demo - static site doing deep research + web search on your local model.

Posted on HN and LinkedIn - would appreciate engagement:

## Version 4: Developer Angle (Technical)

Built something for React devs 👇

**Bodhi App** - local LLM server with OAuth 2.1. Web apps can securely call your model's APIs. No API keys leave your machine.

**bodhi-js** SDK handles OAuth flow + gives OpenAI-compatible client. TypeScript interfaces catch issues at compile time.

**Bodhi Chat** demo - static site doing deep research + web search on your local model.

HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46792987

Want to see more apps built on this pattern:
- Inference (chat, streaming)
- Embeddings + vector search
- RAG pipelines
- Tool use

Got ideas? DM me - will try to make them open source realities.

Also on Product Hunt - try the demo and leave a review:
https://www.producthunt.com/products/bodhi-chat-powered-by-bodhi-app/reviews/new

Upvote/comment if this pattern makes sense for your use case 🙏

## Version 5: Personal Ask (For closer circles)

Hey! 🙏

Posted about Bodhi App/Chat on HN/LinkedIn/Product Hunt. Would really appreciate if you could:
- Upvote on HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46792987
- Like/share on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anagri_we-just-shipped-bodhi-chat-a-demo-of-what-share-7422209769161121792-XXvc
- Try and review on Product Hunt: https://www.producthunt.com/products/bodhi-chat-powered-by-bodhi-app/reviews/new

Bodhi App allows you to run LLMs locally providing OAuth 2.1 security for all API endpoints.

Also - if you have ideas for apps using local LLMs (inference, embeddings, RAG, search), let me know. Want to build more open source tools on this.

Thanks for the support! 🙏

---

## Version 6: Question Format (Engagement Driver)

Quick question for React devs here 👋

Would you use a pattern where your web app talks to user's local LLM instead of your API keys?

Built **Bodhi App** (OAuth 2.1 secured local LLM server) + **bodhi-js** SDK for this.

**Bodhi Chat** demo - static site doing deep research + web search on local models.

- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anagri_we-just-shipped-bodhi-chat-a-demo-of-what-share-7422209769161121792-XXvc

Try it on Product Hunt and leave a review:
https://www.producthunt.com/products/bodhi-chat-powered-by-bodhi-app/reviews/new

Curious about your use cases - what apps would you build with inference, embeddings, RAG, or search on local LLMs? 🤔

---

## Version 7: Full Context (Collaboration Focus)

Hey folks 👋

Been working on something for local LLM users - wanted to share and get your ideas.

**Bodhi App** - like Ollama, but with OAuth 2.1 security baked in from day one (powered by llama.cpp). This means any web app on the internet can securely access your local model's inference, embeddings, and tools APIs - with your explicit consent.

Zero cloud dependency. Zero API costs. Your model, your machine, your data.

Think of it as turning your local LLM into a personal API server that third-party apps can talk to - but only with your permission. You control which apps get access, and you can revoke it anytime.

**Bodhi Chat** - a PoC to show devs what the Bodhi platform can do. Static site on GitHub Pages, connects to your local Bodhi App for deep research, agentic chat with web search. No backend needed from the app developer's side.

The core idea: decouple AI from the app. Users bring their own model and compute. Developers build the experience. Check out the **bodhi-js SDK** to build your own apps on this pattern.

---

Now here's what I'd love from this group 👇

I want to see more apps built on this pattern using basic building blocks:
- Inference (chat completions, streaming)
- Embeddings + vector search
- RAG pipelines
- BM25 search
- Realtime web search
- Tool use / function calling

If you have genuine ideas for apps you'd want built using local LLMs via Bodhi App - share them. Will try to make them open source realities useful for everyone.

Could be productivity tools, research aids, creative assistants, dev tools - whatever solves a real problem for you.

DM me or drop your ideas here!

## Version 8: Problem-Solution Format

Hey everyone 👋

Problem: Web apps using LLMs send data to OpenAI/Anthropic. Your API keys, your costs, your rate limits.

Solution:

**Bodhi App** - runs LLMs locally (like Ollama + OAuth 2.1 security). Web apps access your model's inference/embeddings/tools APIs with user consent.
GitHub: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/BodhiApp

**Bodhi Chat** - demo static site (GitHub Pages) doing deep research + web search on your local model.
GitHub: https://github.com/bodhiapps/chat

**bodhi-js SDK** - build your own apps with this pattern.
GitHub: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/bodhi-js

The idea: decouple AI from app. Users control model and compute, you build experience.

---

Looking for collaboration 👇

Want to see apps built on this using:
- Inference + streaming
- Embeddings + RAG
- BM25 search
- Realtime web search
- Tool use

Got ideas? DM me - will try to make them open source.

## Version 9: ELI5 Version

Hey folks 👋

Working on making local LLMs accessible to web apps.

**Bodhi App** - runs LLMs locally (like Ollama + OAuth 2.1 security). Web apps can safely access your model's APIs with your consent.
GitHub: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/BodhiApp

**Bodhi Chat** - demo static site on GitHub Pages. Deep research + web search on your local model.
GitHub: https://github.com/bodhiapps/chat

Made **bodhi-js SDK** so any dev can build apps like this.
GitHub: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/bodhi-js

Why? Users bring their own AI model and compute. Devs don't manage API keys or costs.

---

Looking for app ideas 👇

What would you build with:
- Inference / chat
- Embeddings / RAG
- Search (BM25, web)
- Tool use

on local LLMs?

## Version 10: Architecture Focus (For technical groups)

Built a demo of client-controlled AI architecture 👇

**Stack:**
- Bodhi App: Local LLM server (llama.cpp + OAuth 2.1). Exposes inference/embeddings/tools APIs under OAuth 2.1 security.
  GitHub: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/BodhiApp
- Bodhi Chat: Static React site (GitHub Pages) with OAuth 2.1 PKCE auth. Deep research + web search.
  GitHub: https://github.com/bodhiapps/chat
- bodhi-js: React SDK wrapping OAuth flow + OpenAI client
  GitHub: https://github.com/BodhiSearch/bodhi-js

**Flow:**
1. User installs Bodhi App locally, loads model
2. Web app redirects to OAuth (hosted identity)
3. User approves scope, web app gets token
4. Web app calls user's local server with OpenAI-compatible requests

**Result:** User consent-based access. User controls compute, model, data. Developer builds UX.

---

Looking for technical collaboration 👇

Want to see apps built using:
- Inference (streaming, function calling)
- Embeddings (vector search, RAG)
- BM25 search
- Realtime web search
- Multi-modal (when supported)

Architecture challenges you'd like solved? DM me.

Will try to make solutions open source for everyone.
