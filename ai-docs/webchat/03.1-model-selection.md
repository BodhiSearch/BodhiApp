# Model Selection Prompt

## Context
Bodhi Web Chat needs to allow users to select which OpenAI-compatible model they want to use for their chat. This is a key configuration step before starting to chat with the LLM.

## Task
Implement the model selection functionality including:
- Model selection dropdown component
- Predefined list of common OpenAI-compatible models retrieved using the API call, only display the top 5
- State management for the selected model
- UI for displaying the currently selected model
- Integration with the API key component

## Guidelines
- Use Shadcn UI Select component for the model dropdown
- Create a clean, intuitive model selection interface
- Implement proper validation for model selection
- Make the model selection prominent in the UI
- Ensure the model selection works with the API key input

## Constraints
- Model selection should be stored in memory only
- Make it clear which model is currently selected
- Focus on simplicity and usability
- Prioritize getting this working quickly for the end-to-end flow
