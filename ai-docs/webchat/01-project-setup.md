# Project Setup Prompt

## Context
We're building a minimal, responsive web application called Bodhi Web Chat that allows users to chat with OpenAI-compatible LLMs by providing their own API key. This is a frontend-only application with no backend.

## Task
Set up the initial project structure with the following:
- Vite + React (TypeScript)
- TailwindCSS configuration
- Shadcn UI integration
- Basic project folder structure
- Essential components setup

## Guidelines
- Use Vite for the project setup
- Implement TypeScript for better type safety
- Configure TailwindCSS with appropriate theming support
- Set up Shadcn UI components library
- Create a clean, organized folder structure
- Initialize Git repository with sensible .gitignore

## Constraints
- This must be a purely frontend application
- No backend components should be added
- Keep dependencies minimal and focused on the core needs
- Use the latest stable versions of all libraries
- Ensure the project structure follows best practices for React applications
