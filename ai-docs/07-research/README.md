# Research Documentation

This section contains technical research documents, dependency analysis, and architectural investigation reports that inform development decisions and strategic planning for the BodhiApp project.

## Contents

### Dependency Analysis
- **[Bodhi Dependency Isolation Analysis](../02-features/completed-stories/20250615-bodhi-dependency-isolation-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of dependencies in `crates/bodhi` that need abstraction through `lib_bodhiserver` for C-FFI compatibility, with detailed implementation plan

### FFI & Language Interoperability
- **[FFI UI Testing Research](20250615-ffi-ui-testing-research.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of FFI approaches for exposing `lib_bodhiserver` to TypeScript/JavaScript for UI testing, with NAPI-RS recommendation

### Security & Authentication
- **[OAuth 2.1 Token Exchange Security Research](token-exchange.md)** - Research on secure token exchange patterns for preventing privilege escalation when third-party clients access our resource server, with scope-limited exchange recommendations

## Purpose

Research documents serve multiple purposes:

1. **Strategic Planning**: Inform architectural decisions and technology choices
2. **Dependency Management**: Analyze and plan dependency isolation and abstraction
3. **Technology Evaluation**: Compare different approaches and technologies
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Provide detailed analysis for complex refactoring tasks
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Document research findings for future reference

## Document Types

### Analysis Reports
Comprehensive analysis of current state, problems, and proposed solutions with:
- Current state assessment
- Problem identification
- Proposed solutions with trade-offs
- Implementation plans with phases
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Technology Research
Investigation of technologies, libraries, and approaches including:
- Technology comparison matrices
- Proof-of-concept findings
- Performance analysis
- Integration complexity assessment
- Recommendation with rationale

### Dependency Studies
Analysis of codebase dependencies including:
- Dependency mapping and usage patterns
- Abstraction strategies
- Migration plans
- Compatibility considerations
- Testing strategies

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Review relevant research before starting major refactoring tasks
- Use implementation plans as roadmaps for complex changes
- Reference dependency analysis when making architectural decisions
- Contribute findings from proof-of-concepts and experiments

### For Architects
- Use research documents to inform strategic decisions
- Reference technology evaluations when choosing new dependencies
- Review dependency analysis when planning system evolution
- Use research findings to guide architectural patterns

### For Project Managers
- Reference implementation plans for effort estimation
- Use risk assessments for project planning
- Review research findings when evaluating feature requests
- Use research documents to communicate technical decisions

## Contributing Research

When adding new research documents:

1. **Follow naming convention**: `YYYYMMDD-topic-description.md`
2. **Include comprehensive analysis**: Current state, problems, solutions, implementation
3. **Provide actionable recommendations**: Clear next steps and implementation guidance
4. **Document assumptions and constraints**: Context that influenced the research
5. **Update this README**: Add new documents to the appropriate section
