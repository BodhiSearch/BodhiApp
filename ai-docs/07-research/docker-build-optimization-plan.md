# Docker Build Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Analysis

### Build Time Breakdown (from job logs):
- **Total Runtime**: ~82 minutes
- **ARM64 Compilation**: 43.8 minutes (53% of total time)
- **AMD64 Compilation**: 21.6 minutes (26% of total time)
- **Docker Push**: 11.2 minutes (14% of total time)
- **Setup/Other**: 5.4 minutes (7% of total time)

### Root Causes:
1. **Multi-platform cross-compilation** - ARM64 is 2x slower than AMD64
2. **Complex Rust dependency graph** - Heavy crates like sqlx, tokio, tauri
3. **Limited dependency caching** - Recompiling dependencies on each build
4. **Release mode overhead** - Unnecessary for development builds

## Phase 1: Immediate Optimizations (Implemented)

### 1. CI Optimization Crate
- **File**: `crates/ci_optims/`
- **Purpose**: Pre-compile all heavy dependencies in separate Docker layer
- **Impact**: 30-50% build time reduction through effective caching

### 2. Platform-Specific Build Strategy
- **Development**: AMD64 only (saves 43+ minutes)
- **Production**: Parallel AMD64 + ARM64 builds
- **Impact**: 70% faster development builds

### 3. Build Variant Optimizations
- **Development**: Debug builds (`cargo build` without `--release`)
- **Production**: Optimized release builds with size optimization
- **Impact**: 40-60% faster development compilation

### 4. Enhanced Caching Strategy
- **CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1**: Incremental compilation
- **Separate cache scopes**: Platform and dependency-specific caching
- **GitHub Actions cache**: Maximized with `mode=max`
- **Impact**: 75-85% faster subsequent builds

### 5. Release Profile Optimization
```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"    # Optimize for size
lto = "thin"       # Link-time optimization (faster than full)
codegen-units = 1  # Better optimization
strip = true       # Remove debug symbols
panic = "abort"    # Smaller binaries
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Development Builds:
- **Before**: 82 minutes (AMD64 + ARM64)
- **After**: 15-25 minutes (AMD64 only, debug, cached)
- **Improvement**: 70-80% faster

### Production Builds:
- **Before**: 82 minutes (sequential)
- **After**: 45-55 minutes (parallel, cached)
- **Improvement**: 35-45% faster

### Cached Builds:
- **Before**: 60-70 minutes
- **After**: 10-20 minutes
- **Improvement**: 75-85% faster

## Phase 2: Future Optimizations (Planned)

### 1. Advanced Dependency Management
- **cargo-chef**: Better Docker layer caching
- **sccache**: Distributed compilation cache
- **Selective dependencies**: Feature-based dependency inclusion

### 2. Build Infrastructure
- **Self-hosted runners**: Persistent caches, better performance
- **Docker Hub migration**: Evaluate better global CDN performance
- **Registry mirrors**: Regional optimization

### 3. Binary Optimization
- **Dynamic linking**: Reduce binary size further
- **Feature flags**: Conditional compilation
- **Dead code elimination**: More aggressive optimization

### 4. Advanced Caching
- **Registry-based caching**: Use Docker registry as cache backend
- **Cross-job caching**: Share caches between different workflows
- **Incremental builds**: Only rebuild changed components

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 1 (Current)
- [x] CI optimization crate created
- [x] Platform-specific workflows
- [x] Enhanced caching configuration
- [x] Release profile optimization
- [x] Local development targets
- [x] Development AMD64-only builds

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 2 (Future)
- [ ] cargo-chef integration
- [ ] sccache implementation
- [ ] Self-hosted runner evaluation
- [ ] Registry optimization analysis
- [ ] Advanced binary optimization

## Testing Plan

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Test optimized development build
make docker.build.dev GH_PAT=your_token

# Test optimized production build
make docker.build.optimized GH_PAT=your_token BUILD_VARIANT=production
```

### CI Testing:
1. Create development tag to test AMD64-only workflow
2. Monitor build times and cache effectiveness
3. Validate binary functionality and size
4. Test production multi-platform builds

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Build time reduction**: Target 70% for development, 40% for production
- **Cache hit rate**: Target >80% for dependency layers
- **Binary size**: Target 20-30% reduction
- **Registry push time**: Target <5 minutes for development

### Success Criteria:
- Development builds complete in <25 minutes
- Production builds complete in <55 minutes
- Cached builds complete in <20 minutes
- No functionality regression
