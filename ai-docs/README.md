- **Hierarchical organization**: Logical grouping by purpose and audience

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding or updating documentation:

1. **Choose the appropriate section** based on content type and target audience
2. **Follow naming conventions** (kebab-case for files, descriptive names)
3. **Update this index** when adding new documents or changing structure
4. **Include cross-references** to related documents for comprehensive coverage
5. **Consider consolidation** opportunities to avoid duplication

### Content Guidelines
- **Architecture**: Technical implementation details, system design, development standards
- **Features**: User-facing capabilities, development stories, implementation status
