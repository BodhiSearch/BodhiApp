# NAPI-RS FFI Implementation Handoff - Continuation Instructions

## Current State Summary

The NAPI-RS FFI implementation is **95% complete** with a working TypeScript test project that successfully:
- Initializes BodhiApp from JavaScript/TypeScript
- Starts the HTTP server process 
- Handles errors and cleanup properly
- Generates TypeScript types automatically

**The implementation stops at**: Server startup fails because it cannot find the llama-server executable, even though we only need the `/ping` endpoint which doesn't require llama-server.

## Exact Continuation Point

**Current Error:**
```
exec not found at /tmp/aarch64-apple-darwin/metal/llama-server
‚ùå Test failed with error: [Error: exec_not_exists] { code: 'GenericFailure' }
```

for the BODHI_EXEC_LOOKUP_PATH, for time being resolve  crates/bodhi/src-tauri/bin absolute path and set this in the settings as BODHI_EXEC_LOOKUP_PATH
Set BODHI_PORT in settings so do not have to give random port
check @setting_service.rs on the cascading values for settings. you can even create a yaml file with settings in bodhi_home folder and it is going to be picked up automatically, no need to set in the api

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ NAPI-RS bindings compile and load successfully
- ‚úÖ App initialization completes (reaches "Ready" state)
- ‚úÖ Server startup process begins (reaches "Running" state)
- ‚úÖ All TypeScript types generate correctly
- ‚úÖ Error handling and cleanup work properly

**What Needs Resolution:**
- üöß Server startup requires llama-server executable even for simple health check endpoints
- üöß Port extraction when using port=0 for automatic assignment

## Critical Implementation Details

### Environment Setup Requirements (ESSENTIAL)

The test environment requires these specific configurations:

```typescript
// In examples/napi-test/src/index.ts
const config: AppConfig = {
  envType: 'development',        // MUST be snake_case, not 'Development'
  appType: 'container',          // MUST be snake_case, not 'Container'
  appVersion: '1.0.0-napi-test',
  authUrl: 'https://dev-id.getbodhi.app',
  authRealm: 'bodhi',
  encryptionKey: 'test-encryption-key',  // CRITICAL: bypasses keyring
  execLookupPath: '/tmp'                 // CRITICAL: required for server init
};
```

### Dependency Configuration (ESSENTIAL)

```toml
# In crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi/Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
lib_bodhiserver = { workspace = true }
services = { workspace = true, features = ["test-utils"] }  # REQUIRED
objs = { workspace = true, features = ["test-utils"] }      # REQUIRED
```

### Localization Service Initialization (CRITICAL)

```rust
// In crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi/src/app_initializer.rs initialize() method
// MUST be called before setup_app_dirs() or app will panic
let localization_service = Arc::new(FluentLocalizationService::new_standalone());
set_mock_localization_service(localization_service.clone());
```

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Mock Executable Creation (Highest Priority)

**Problem**: Server startup requires llama-server executable 

**Solution Approach**: set the BODHI_EXEC_LOOKUP_PATH to as mentioned above 

**Alternative**: Investigate if there's a way to bypass executable requirement for test environments.

### 2. Port Extraction Implementation

**Current Issue**: When using `port: 0`, need to extract the actual assigned port from the server handle.

**Location**: `crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi/src/app_initializer.rs` in `start_server()` method

Solution: either set BODHI_PORT in settings so do not have to give random port, or create settings.yaml in the bodhi_home, check setting_service.rs

### 3. Complete HTTP Testing

Once executable issue is resolved, the test should successfully:
- Start the server
- Make HTTP request to `/ping` endpoint  
- Receive `{"message": "pong"}` response
- Shutdown cleanly

## Debugging Commands That Work

```bash
# Test Rust compilation
cargo test -p lib_bodhiserver_napi

# Build NAPI bindings
cd crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi && npm run build

# Run TypeScript test
cd examples/napi-test && npm test

# Check generated TypeScript types
cat crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi/index.d.ts
```

## Key Gotchas & Lessons Learned

### 1. String Case Sensitivity
- EnvType/AppType enums use snake_case serialization: `"development"` not `"Development"`
- This caused initial parsing failures

### 2. Test Environment Dependencies
- Cannot use `DefaultEnvWrapper` - must use `EnvWrapperStub` with test environment variables
- Localization service must be initialized before any app setup
- Both `services` and `objs` crates need `test-utils` features

### 3. NAPI-RS Async Functions
- Must mark async functions as `unsafe` in NAPI-RS
- Error conversion requires manual `.map_err()` calls
- Cannot return references from NAPI functions (had to change `get_status()` to return `u32`)

### 4. Build System
- NAPI-RS requires both Rust and npm build steps
- TypeScript types are auto-generated but need proper npm package structure
- Workspace dependencies work but need explicit feature flags

## Files Modified/Created

**New Files:**
- `crates/lib_bodhiserver_napi/` (entire crate)
- `crates/lib_bodhiserver/src/static_dir_utils.rs`
- `examples/napi-test/` (entire test project)

**Modified Files:**
- `Cargo.toml` (workspace members and dependencies)
- `crates/lib_bodhiserver/src/lib.rs` (re-exports)

## Success Validation

When continuation is complete, this should work:

```bash
cd examples/napi-test && npm test
```

Expected output:
```

```

## Architecture Notes

The implementation successfully demonstrates the "dumb frontend" architecture where:
- TypeScript provides simple configuration
- Rust handles all complex logic and validation
- Error handling flows cleanly from Rust to JavaScript
- Resource management is handled automatically

This creates a solid foundation for UI testing with programmatic server control.
